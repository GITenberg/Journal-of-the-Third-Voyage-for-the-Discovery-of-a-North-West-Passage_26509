5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>William Edward Parry, the son of a physician, was born at Bath
in December, 1790.&nbsp; At the age of thirteen he was entered as
a first-class volunteer on board the flag-ship of the Channel
fleet, and after seven years&rsquo; service and careful study of
his profession he obtained a commission in 1810 as lieutenant in
the navy.&nbsp; He was then at once, aged twenty, sent to the
Arctic seas, where he was during two or three years in command of
a ship for protection of the British whale fisheries and for
revision of the admiralty charts.&nbsp; In 1813 he was recalled
from that service and sent on blockade service to the North
American station, where he remained about four years, and
occupied his leisure in writing a book on &ldquo;Nautical
Astronomy by Night,&rdquo; which he published upon his return to
England in 1817.</p>
<p>At that time the search for a North-West Passage to Eastern
Asia had been suspended for more than half a century.&nbsp; No
expedition had been sent <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>out since 1746.&nbsp; But after
Lieutenant Parry&rsquo;s return from the North American station,
an expedition was prepared under Sir John Ross in the
<i>Isabella</i>, which sailed in April, 1818, accompanied by the
<i>Alexander</i>, to the command of which Parry was appointed,
Sir John Ross being chief of the expedition.&nbsp; They went by
Davis&rsquo;s Straits to Lancaster Sound, where Sir John Ross
gave up hope of success and turned back; though Lieutenant Parry
would have gone on.&nbsp; Next year Parry was entrusted with an
expedition of his own, which set out in May, 1819, and reached
Lancaster Sound in July, discovered Prince Regent&rsquo;s Inlet,
and Barrow Straits, named after Sir John Barrow, Secretary to the
Admiralty, who was active promoter of these expeditions.&nbsp;
Parry wintered among the ice and returned next year, having
pushed Arctic discovery by thirty degrees of longitude farther
than any who had gone before.&nbsp; That was Parry&rsquo;s first
voyage, from which he returned to be received with triumph by his
countrymen.&nbsp; He was advanced to the rank of Commander in
November, 1820, and made a Fellow of the Royal Society.&nbsp; He
had shown in what direction to proceed with further search, and
at the age of thirty <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>had established for himself a place of
lasting honour in the history of English navigation.</p>
<p>Commander Parry was sent on a second expedition in 1821, from
which he returned in 1823.&nbsp; He was to explore the Fox
Channel, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it was connected
with the Arctic Sea of his first voyage.&nbsp; This voyage had no
important results; and in 1824 Parry started again on the third
voyage, of which this volume contains his Journal.&nbsp; In 1827
he sailed again in the <i>Hecla</i>, but found himself sledging
over ice that floated southward as fast as he travelled forward
on it northward.&nbsp; He returned then to the work ashore, as a
hydrographer, for which his thorough knowledge of navigation
marked him out.&nbsp; Desire for a more active life caused him to
spend four or five years in Australia (from 1829 to 1834) as
Commissioner to the Agricultural Company of Australia.&nbsp; He
was knighted, and became in 1852 a Rear-Admiral.&nbsp; Sir Edward
Parry was Lieutenant-Governor of Greenwich Hospital at the time
of his death, in July, 1855.</p>

9</span>THIRD VOYAGE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A NORTH-WEST
PASSAGE.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the want of success of the late Expedition to
the Polar Seas, it was resolved to make another attempt to effect
a passage by sea, between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&nbsp;
The chief attentions in the equipment of the present expedition
consisted in the placing of Sylvester&rsquo;s warming stove in
the very bottom of the ship&rsquo;s hold, in substituting a small
quantity of salt beef for a part of the pork, and in furnishing a
much larger supply of newly corned beef.&nbsp; Preserved carrots
and parsnips, salmon, cream, pickles of onions, beetroot,
cabbage, and, to make the most of our stowage, split pease
instead of whole ones, were supplied.&nbsp; A small quantity of
beef pemmican, made by pounding the meat with a certain portion
of fat, as described by Captain Franklin, was also furnished.</p>
<p>To the officers, seamen, and marines my best acknowledgments
are once more due, for the zealous support I have at all times
received from them in the course of this service; and I am happy
to repeat my conviction that, had it depended on their conduct
and exertion, our most sanguine expectations would, long ere
this, have been crowned with complete success.</p>

10</span>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Passage to the Whale-fish Islands, and Removal
of Stores from the Transport&mdash;Enter the Ice in
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay&mdash;Difficulties of Penetrating to the
Westward&mdash;Quit the Ice in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay&mdash;Remarks
on the Obstructions encountered by the Ships, and on the Severity
of the Season.</p>
<p>The equipment of the <i>Hecla</i> and <i>Fury</i>, and the
loading of the <i>William Harris</i> transport, being completed,
we began to move down the river from Deptford on the 8th of May,
1824, and on the 10th, by the assistance of the steamboat, the
three ships had reached Northfleet, where they received their
powder and their ordnance stores.&nbsp; Two days were here
employed in fixing, under the superintendence of Mr. Barlow and
Lieutenant Foster, the plate, invented by the former gentleman,
for correcting the deviation of the compass produced by the
attraction of the ship&rsquo;s iron; and the continuance of
strong easterly winds prevented our getting to the Nore till the
16th.&nbsp; During our stay at Northfleet the ships were visited
by Viscount Melville, and the other Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, who were pleased to approve of our general equipment
and arrangements.</p>
<p>During our passage across the Atlantic in June, and afterwards
on our way up Davis&rsquo;s Strait, we threw overboard daily a
strong copper cylinder, containing the usual papers, giving an
account of our situation.&nbsp; We also took every opportunity
afforded by light winds, to try the temperature of the sea at
different depths, as compared with that at the surface.</p>
<p>I now determined, as the quickest and most secure mode of
clearing the transport, to anchor at the Whale-fish Islands,
rather than incur the risk of hampering and <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>damaging her
among the ice.&nbsp; Fresh gales and thick weather, however,
prevented our doing so till the 26th, when we anchored at eight
A.M., in seventeen fathoms, mooring the ships by hawsers to the
rocks, and then immediately commenced our work.&nbsp; In the
meantime the observatory and instruments were landed on a small
island, called by the Danes Boat Island, where Lieutenant Foster
and myself carried on the magnetic and other observations during
the stay of the Expedition at this anchorage, of which a survey
was also made.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 3rd of July, the whole of our
stores being removed, and Lieutenant Pritchard having received
his orders, together with our despatches and letters for England,
the <i>William Harris</i> weighed with a light wind from the
northward, and was towed out to sea by our boats.&nbsp; The day
proving calm, we employed it in swinging the <i>Hecla</i>, in
order to obtain the amount of the deviation of the magnetic
needle, and to fix afresh the iron plate for correcting it.&nbsp;
On the following morning, the wind being southerly, the pilots
came on board, and the <i>Hecla</i> weighed to run through the
north passage; in doing which she grounded on a rock lying
directly in the channel, and having only thirteen feet upon it at
low water, which our sounding boats had missed, and of which the
pilot was ignorant.&nbsp; The tide being that of ebb we were
unable to heave the ship off immediately, and at low water she
had sewed three feet forward.&nbsp; It was not till half-past one
P.M., that she floated, when it became necessary to drop her down
between the rock and the shore with hawsers; after which we made
sail, and being soon after joined by the <i>Fury</i>, which came
out by the other channel, we stood round the islands to the
northwards.&nbsp; This rock was not <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the only one
found by our boats which may prove dangerous to ships going in
and out of this harbour, and with which our pilots were
unacquainted.&nbsp; Another was discovered by Mr. Head, about
one-third of the distance across from Kron Prins Island to the
opposite shore of the S.E. entrance, and has not more than
eighteen feet water on it at low tide; it lies very much in the
way of ships coming in at that channel, which is the most
commonly used.&nbsp; The latitude of the island, on which the
observations were made, called by the Danes Boat Island, is
74&deg; 28&prime; 15&Prime;; its longitude by our chronometers,
53&deg; 12&prime; 56&Prime;; the dip of the magnetic needle,
82&deg; 53&prime; 66&Prime;; and the variation, 70&deg; 23&prime;
57&Prime; westerly.&nbsp; The time of high water, at new moon, on
the 26th of June, was a quarter-past eight, the highest tides
being the third and fourth after the conjunction, and the
perpendicular rise seven feet and a half.</p>
<p>The ships standing in towards Lievely on the afternoon of the
5th, Lieutenant Graah very kindly came off to the <i>Fury</i>,
which happened to be the nearest in shore, for the purpose of
taking leave of us.&nbsp; On his quitting the ship a salute of
ten guns was fired at Lievely, which we returned with an equal
number; and I sent to Lieutenant Graah, by a canoe that came on
board the <i>Hecla</i>, an account of the situation of the rocks
we had discovered.&nbsp; Light northerly winds, together with the
dull sailing of our now deeply laden ships, prevented our making
much progress for several days, and kept us in the neighbourhood
of numerous icebergs, which it is dangerous to approach when
there is any swell.&nbsp; We counted from the deck, at one time,
no less than one hundred and three of these immense bodies, some
of them from one to two hundred feet in height above the sea; and
it was necessary, <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in one or two instances, to tow the
ships clear of them with the boats.&nbsp; We had occasion, about
this time, to remark the more than usual frequency of fogs with a
northerly wind, a circumstance from which the whalers are
accustomed to augur a considerable extent of open water in that
direction.</p>
<p>The ice soon beginning to close around us, our progress became
so slow that, on the 17th, we saw a ship at the margin of the
&ldquo;pack,&rdquo; and two more on the following day.&nbsp; We
supposed these to be whalers, which, after trying to cross the
ice to the northward, had returned to make the attempt in the
present latitude; a supposition which our subsequent difficulties
served to strengthen.&nbsp; From this time, indeed, the
obstructions from the quantity, magnitude, and closeness of the
ice, were such as to keep our people almost constantly employed
in heaving, warping, or sawing through it; and yet with so little
success that, at the close of the month of July, we had only
penetrated seventy miles to the westward, or to the longitude of
about 62&deg; 10&prime;.&nbsp; Here, while closely beset, on the
1st of August, we encountered a hard gale from the south-east,
which pressing the ice together in every direction, by mass
overlaying mass for hours together, the <i>Hecla</i> received
several very awkward &ldquo;nips,&rdquo; and was once fairly laid
on her broadside by a strain which must inevitably have crushed a
vessel of ordinary strength.&nbsp; In such cases, the ice is
forced under a ship&rsquo;s bottom on one side, and on the other
up her side, both powers thus acting in such a manner as to bring
her on her &ldquo;beam-ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is, in fact, the
most favourable manner in which a ship can receive the pressure,
and would perhaps only occur with ice comparatively not very
heavy, though sufficiently so, it is said, to have run completely
over a <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>ship in some extreme and fatal
cases.&nbsp; With ice of still more formidable dimensions a
vessel would probably, by an equal degree of pressure, be
absolutely crushed, in consequence of the increased difficulty of
sinking it on one side, and causing it to rise on the other.</p>
<p><i>Sept. 9th</i>.&mdash;I shall doubtless be readily excused
for not having entered in this journal a detailed narrative of
the obstacles we met with, and of the unwearied exertions of the
officers and men to overcome them, during the tedious eight weeks
employed in crossing this barrier.&nbsp; I have avoided this
detail because, while it might appear an endeavour to magnify
ordinary difficulties, which it is our business to overcome
rather than to discuss, I am convinced that no description of
mine, nor even the minute formality of the log-book, could convey
an adequate idea of the truth.&nbsp; The strain we constantly had
occasion to heave on the hawsers, as springs to force the ships
through the ice, was such as perhaps no ships ever before
attempted; and by means of Phillips&rsquo;s invaluable capstan,
we often separated floes of such magnitude as must otherwise have
baffled every effort.&nbsp; In doing this, it was next to
impossible to avoid exposing the men to very great risk from the
frequent breaking of the hawsers.&nbsp; On one occasion, three of
the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> seamen were knocked down as
instantaneously as by a gunshot by the sudden flying-out of an
anchor; and a marine of the <i>Fury</i> suffered in a similar
manner when working at the capstan; but, providentially, they all
escaped with severe contusions.&nbsp; A more serious accident
occurred in the breaking of the spindle of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> windlass, depriving her of the use of the
windlass-end during the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The constant besetment of the ships, and our daily <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>observations for latitude and longitude, afforded a
favourable opportunity for ascertaining precisely the set of any
currents by which the whole body of ice might be actuated.&nbsp;
By attending very carefully to all the circumstances, it was
evident that a daily set to the southward obtained, when the wind
was northerly, differing in amount from two or three to eight or
ten miles per day, according to the strength of the breeze; but a
northerly current was equally apparent, and fully to the same
amount, whenever the wind blew from the southward.&nbsp; A
circumstance more remarkable than these, however, forced itself
strongly upon my notice at this time, which was, that a
<i>westerly</i> set was very frequently apparent, even against a
fresh breeze blowing from that quarter.&nbsp; I mention the
circumstance in this place, because I may hereafter have to offer
a remark or two on this fact in connection with some others of a
similar nature noticed elsewhere.</p>
<p>With respect to the dimensions of the ice through which we had
now scrambled our way, principally by warping and towing a
distance of between three and four hundred miles, I remarked that
it for the most part increased, as well in the thickness as the
extent of the floes, as we advanced westward about the parallel
of 71&deg;.&nbsp; During our subsequent progress to the north, we
also met with some of enormous dimensions, several of the floes,
to which we applied our hawsers and the power of the improved
capstan, being at their margin more than twenty feet above the
level of the sea, and over some of these we could not see from
the mast-head.&nbsp; Upon the whole, however, the magnitude of
the ice became somewhat less towards the north-west; and within
thirty miles of that margin the masses were comparatively <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>small, and their thickness much diminished.&nbsp; Bergs
were in sight during the whole passage; but they were more
numerous towards the middle of the &ldquo;pack,&rdquo; and rather
the most so to the southward.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Enter Sir James Lancaster&rsquo;s
Sound&mdash;Land at Cape Warrender&mdash;Meet with young
ice&mdash;Ships beset and carried near the shore&mdash;Driven
back to Navy-board Inlet&mdash;Run to the westward, and enter
Prince Regent&rsquo;s Inlet&mdash;Arrival at Port Bowen.</p>
<p>All our past obstacles were in a moment forgotten when we once
more saw an open sea before us; but it must be confessed that it
was not so easy to forget that the middle of September was
already near at hand, without having brought us even to the
entrance of Sir James Lancaster&rsquo;s Sound.&nbsp; That not a
moment might be lost, however, in pushing to the westward, a
press of canvas was crowded, and being happily favoured with an
easterly breeze, on the morning of the 10th of September we
caught a glimpse of the high bold land on the north side of the
magnificent inlet up which our course was once more to be
directed.&nbsp; From the time of our leaving the main body of ice
we met with none of any kind, and the entrance to the Sound was,
as usual, entirely free from it, except here and there a berg,
floating about in that solitary grandeur of which these enormous
masses, when occurring in the midst of an extensive sea, are
calculated to convey so sublime an idea.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, the ships being taken a-back with
a fresh westerly breeze when near Cape Warrender, I landed in a
small bay close to the westward <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of it,
accompanied by several of the officers, in order to examine the
country, and to make the necessary observations.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th we were once more favoured with a
breeze from the eastward, but so light and unsteady that our
progress was vexatiously slow; and on the 13th, when within seven
leagues of Cape York, we had the mortification to perceive the
sea ahead of us covered with young ice, the thermometer having
for two days past ranged only from 18&deg; to 20&deg;.&nbsp; On
reaching it we had, as usual, recourse to &ldquo;sallying,&rdquo;
breaking it with boats ahead, and various other expedients, all
alike ineffectual without a fresh and free breeze furnishing a
constant impetus; so that, after seven or eight hours of
unsuccessful labour in this way, we were obliged to remain as we
were, fairly and immovably beset.</p>
<p>It now appeared high time to determine as to the propriety of
still continuing our efforts to push to the westward or of
returning to England, according to my instructions on that head
under particular circumstances.&nbsp; As the crossing of the ice
in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay had of itself unexpectedly occupied nearly
the whole of one season, it could not, of course, be considered
that the attempt to penetrate to the westward in the manner
directed by their lordships had as yet been made, nor could it,
indeed, be made during the present year.&nbsp; I could not,
therefore, have a moment&rsquo;s hesitation as to the propriety
of pushing on as far as the present season would permit, and then
giving a fair trial during the whole of the next summer to the
route I was directed by my instructions to pursue.&nbsp; In
order, however, to confirm my own opinion on this subject, I
requested to be furnished with that of Captain Hoppner; and
finding that his views entirely agreed with <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>my own, I
resolved still to pursue our object by all the means in our
power.</p>
<p>The next breeze sprang up from the westward, drawing also from
the southward at times, out of Prince Regent&rsquo;s Inlet, and
for three days we were struggling with the young ice to little or
no purpose, now and then gaining half a mile of ground to
windward in a little &ldquo;hole&rdquo; of open water, then
losing as much by the necessity of bearing up or wearing (for the
ice was too strong to allow us to tack), sallying from morning to
night with all hands, and with the watch at night, two boats
constantly under the bows; and, after all, rather losing ground
than otherwise, while the young ice was every hour increasing in
thickness.</p>
<p>On the 17th, when we had driven back rather to the eastward of
Admiralty Inlet, an easterly breeze again enabled us to make some
progress.&nbsp; The sea was now for the most part covered with
young ice, which had become so thick as to look white throughout
its whole extent.&nbsp; The holes of water could now, therefore,
be more distinctly seen, and by taking advantage of these we
succeeded in making a few miles of westing, the
&ldquo;leads&rdquo; taking us more in-shore, towards Admiralty
Inlet, than before.&nbsp; Towards sunset we became more and more
hampered, and were eventually beset during the night.&nbsp; A
breeze sprang up from the westward, which increasing to a fresh
gale, we found ourselves at daylight far to the eastward, and
also within two miles of the land, near a long low point, which
on the former voyages had not been seen.&nbsp; The sea was
covered with ice between us and the shore, all of this
year&rsquo;s formation, but now of considerable thickness and
formidable appearance.&nbsp; The wind continuing strong, the
whole body was constantly pressed in upon the land, <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>bearing the ships along with it, and doubling one sheet
over another, sometimes to a hundred thicknesses.&nbsp; We
quickly shoaled the water from seventy to forty fathoms, the
latter depth occurring about a mile from the beach; and after
this we drifted but little, the ice being blocked up between the
point and a high perpendicular berg lying aground off it.</p>
<p>The sails being furled, and the top-gallant yards got down, we
now considered ourselves fortunate in our situation; for had we
been only a quarter of a mile farther out we should have been
within the influence of a current that was there sweeping the
whole body of ice to the eastward, at the rate of a mile and a
half an hour.&nbsp; Indeed, at times this current was disposed to
approach us still nearer, carrying away pieces of ice close to
our quarter; but by means of long hawsers, secured to the
heaviest and most compact of the small floes in-shore of us, we
contrived to hold on.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, it
evidently became expedient to endeavour, by sawing, to get the
ships as close in-shore as possible, so as to secure them either
to grounded ice or by anchoring within the shelter of a bay at no
great distance inside of us; for it now seemed not unlikely that
winter was about to put a premature stop to all further
operations at sea for this season.&nbsp; At all events it was
necessary to consult the immediate safety of the ships, and to
keep them from being drifted back to the eastward.&nbsp; I
therefore gave orders for endeavouring to get the ships in
towards the bay by cutting through what level floes still
remained.&nbsp; At the same time an officer was despatched to
examine the shore, which was found safe, with regular soundings
in every part.&nbsp; So strong had been the pressure while the
ice was forcing in upon us, that on the 20th, <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>after
liberating the <i>Hecla</i> on one side, she was as firmly
cemented to it on the other as after a winter&rsquo;s formation,
and we could only clear her by heavy and repeated
&ldquo;sallying.&rdquo;&nbsp; After cutting in two or three
hundred yards, while the people were at dinner on the 21st, our
canal closed, by the external pressure coming upon the parts
which we had weakened, and in a few minutes the whole was once
more in motion, or, as the seamen not inaptly expressed it,
&ldquo;alive,&rdquo; mass doubling under mass, and raising those
which were uppermost to a considerable height.&nbsp; The ice thus
pressed together was now about ten feet in thickness in some
places, and on an average not less than four or five, so that
while thus forced in upon a ship, although soft in itself, it
caused her to tremble exceedingly; a sensation, indeed, commonly
experienced in forcing through young ice of considerable
thickness.&nbsp; We were now once more obliged to be quiet
spectators of what was going on around us, having with extreme
difficulty succeeded in saving most of our tools that were lying
on the ice when the squeezing suddenly began.&nbsp; Towards
evening we made fast to a stationary floe, at the distance of one
mile from the beach, in eighteen fathoms, where we remained
tolerably quiet for the night, the ice outside of us, and as far
as we could see, setting constantly at a great rate to the
eastward.&nbsp; Some of our gentlemen, who had landed in the
course of the day, and who had to scramble their way on board
over the ice in motion, described the bay as deeper than it
appeared from the offing.&nbsp; Dr. Neill &ldquo;found, on such
parts of the beach as were not covered with ice or snow,
fragments of bituminous shale, flinty slate, and iron-stone,
interspersed amongst a blue-coloured limestone gravel.&nbsp; As
far as he was able to travel inland, the surface was <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>composed of secondary limestone, partially covered with
a thin layer of calc-sinter.&nbsp; From the scantiness of the
vegetation here, the limestone seemed likely to contain a large
proportion of magnesia.&nbsp; Dr. Neill was about to examine for
coal, which the formation led him to expect, when the ice was
observed to be in motion, obliging him hastily to return on
board.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lieutenant Ross &ldquo;found, about
two-thirds up a small peaked insulated hill of limestone, between
three and four hundred feet above the level of the sea, several
pieces of coal, which he found to burn with a clear bright flame,
crackling much, and throwing off slaty splinters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hares&rsquo; burrows were numerous on this hill; Lieutenant
Ross saw two of these animals, one of which he killed.&nbsp; A
fox was also observed in its summer dress; and these, with a pair
of ravens, some wingless ducks, and several snow-buntings, were
all the animals noticed at this place.</p>
<p>A sudden motion of the ice on the morning of the 22nd,
occasioned by a change of wind to the S.E., threatened to carry
us directly off the land.&nbsp; It was now more than ever
desirable to hold on, as this breeze was likely to clear the
shore, and at the same time to give us a run to the
westward.&nbsp; Hawsers were therefore run out to the land-ice,
composed of some heavy masses, almost on the beach.&nbsp; With
the <i>Hecla</i> this succeeded, but the <i>Fury</i>, being much
farther from the shore, soon began to move out with the whole
body of ice, which, carrying her close to the large berg off the
point, swept her round the latter, where, after great exertion,
Captain Hoppner succeeded in getting clear, and then made sail to
beat back to us.&nbsp; In the meantime the strain put upon the
<i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> hawsers being too great for them, they
snapped one after another, <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and a
bower-anchor was let go as a last resource.&nbsp; It was one of
Hawkins&rsquo;s, with the double fluke, and immediately brought
up, not merely the ship, but a large floe of young ice, which had
just broken our stream-cable.&nbsp; All hands were sent upon the
floe to cut it up ahead, and the whole operation was a novel and,
at times, a fearful one; for the ice, being weakened by the
cutting, would suddenly gather fresh way astern, carrying men and
tools with it, while the chain-cable continued to plough through
it in a manner which gave one the idea of something alive, and
continually renewing its attacks.&nbsp; The anchor held
surprisingly, and after this tremendous strain had been put upon
it for above an hour, we had fairly cut the floe in two, and the
ship was riding in clear water about half a mile from the
shore.</p>
<p>I was now in hopes we should have made some progress, for a
large channel of clear water was left open in-shore; a breeze
blew off the land, and the temperature of the atmosphere had
again risen considerably.&nbsp; We had not sailed five miles,
however, when a westerly wind took us aback, and a most dangerous
swell set directly upon the shore, obliging me immediately to
stand off the land; and the <i>Fury</i> being still to the
eastward of the point, I ran round it, in order to rejoin her
before sunset.&nbsp; The current was here setting very fast to
the eastward, not less, I think, in some places, than two miles
an hour, so that, even in a clear sea, we had little chance of
stemming it, much less beset as we were in young ice during an
unusually dark night of nine or ten hours&rsquo; duration, with a
heavy fall of snow.&nbsp; The consequence was, that when we made
the land on the morning of the 23rd, we had been drifted the
incredible distance of eight or nine leagues during the night,
finding ourselves off the Wollaston <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Islands at
the entrance of Navy Board Inlet.&nbsp; We stood in under the
islands to look for anchorage during the night, but the water
being everywhere too deep close to the shore, we made fast at
sunset to some very heavy ice upon a point, which we took to be
the main land, but which Captain Hoppner afterwards found to be
upon one of the islands, which are at least four in number.</p>
<p>After midnight on the 27th the wind began to moderate, and by
degrees also drew more to the southward than before.&nbsp; At
daylight, therefore, we found ourselves seven or eight miles from
the land; but no ice was in sight, except the
&ldquo;sludge,&rdquo; of honey-like consistence, with which
almost the whole sea was covered.&nbsp; A strong blink, extending
along the eastern horizon, pointed out the position of the main
body of ice, which was farther distant from the eastern shore of
the inlet than I ever saw it.&nbsp; Being assisted by a fine
working breeze, which at the same time prevented the formation of
any more ice to obstruct us, we made considerable progress along
the land, and at noon were nearly abreast of Jackson Inlet, which
we now saw to be considerably larger than our distant view of it
on the former voyage had led us to suppose.&nbsp; We found also
that what at a distance appeared an island in the entrance was in
reality a dark-looking rocky hill, on the south side.&nbsp; A few
more tacks brought us to the entrance of Port Bowen, which for
two or three days past I had determined to make our
wintering-place, if, as there was but little reason to expect, we
should be so fortunate as to push the ships thus far.&nbsp; My
reasons for coming to this determination, in which Captain
Hoppner&rsquo;s opinion also served to confirm me, will be
sufficiently gathered from the operations of the preceding
fortnight, which convinced me that the precarious chance <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>of making a few miles&rsquo; more progress could no
longer be suffered to weigh against the evident risk now
attending further attempts at navigation: a risk not confined to
the mere exposure of the ships to imminent danger, or the hazard
of being shut out of a winter harbour, but to one which, I may be
permitted to say, we all dreaded as much as these&mdash;the too
obvious probability of our once more being driven back to the
eastward, should we again become hampered in the young ice.&nbsp;
Joining to this the additional consideration that no known place
of security existed to the southward on this coast, I had not the
smallest hesitation in availing myself of the present opportunity
to get the ships into harbour.&nbsp; Beating up, therefore, to
Port Bowen, we found it filled with &ldquo;old&rdquo; and
&ldquo;hummocky&rdquo; ice, attached to the shores on both sides,
as low down as about three-quarters of a mile below Stoney
Island.&nbsp; Here we made fast in sixty-two fathoms of water,
running our hawsers far in upon the ice, in case of its breaking
off at the margin.</p>
<p>On entering Port Bowen, I was forcibly struck with the
circumstance of the cliffs on the south side of the harbour
being, in many places, covered with a layer of blue
transparent-looking ice, occasioned undoubtedly by the snow
partially thawing there, and then being arrested by the frost,
and presenting a feature very indicative of the late cold
summer.&nbsp; The same thing was observed on all the land to
which we made a near approach on the south side of Barrow&rsquo;s
Strait this season, especially about Cape York and Eardley Bay;
but as we had never been close to these parts of the shore in
1819, it did not occur to me as anything new or worthy of
notice.&nbsp; At Port Bowen, however, which in that year was
closely examined, I am quite certain that no such thing was to be
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>seen, even in the month of August, the cliffs being then
quite clear of snow, except here and there a patch of drift.</p>
<p>Late as we had this year been (about the middle of October) in
reaching Sir James Lancaster&rsquo;s Sound, there would still
have been time for a ship engaged in a whale-fishery to have
reaped a tolerable harvest, as we met with a number of whales in
every part of it, and even as far as the entrance of Port
Bowen.&nbsp; The number registered altogether in our journals is
between twenty and thirty, but I have no doubt that many more
than these were seen, and that a ship expressly on the look-out
for them would have found full occupation for her boats.&nbsp;
Several which came near us were of large and
&ldquo;payable&rdquo; dimensions.&nbsp; I confess, however, that
had I been within the Sound, in a whaler, towards the close of so
unfavourable a season as this, with the young ice forming so
rapidly on the whole extent of the sea, I should not have been
disposed to persevere in the fishery under circumstances so
precarious, and to a ship unprepared for a winter involving such
evident risk.&nbsp; It is probable, however, that on the outside
the formation of young ice would have been much retarded by the
swell; and I am inclined to believe that a season so unfavourable
as this will be found of rare occurrence.</p>
<p>We observed a great many narwhals in different parts of
Barrow&rsquo;s Strait, and a few walruses, and should perhaps
have seen many more of both, but for the continual presence of
the young ice.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Winter Arrangements&mdash;Improvements in
Warming and Ventilating the Ships&mdash;Masquerades adopted as an
Amusement to the Men&mdash;Establishment of
Schools&mdash;Astronomical Observations&mdash;Meteorological
Phenomena.</p>
<p><i>October</i>.&mdash;Our present winter arrangements so
closely resembled, in general, those before adopted, that a fresh
description of them here would prove little more than a
repetition of that already contained in the narratives of our
former voyages.&nbsp; On each succeeding occasion, however, some
improvements were made which, for the benefit of those hereafter
engaged in similar enterprises, it may be proper to record.&nbsp;
For all those whose lot it may be to succeed us, sooner or later,
in these inhospitable regions, may be assured that it is only by
rigid and unremitted attention to these and numberless other
&ldquo;little things&rdquo; that they can hope to enjoy the good
state of health which, under the Divine blessing, it has always
been our happiness, in so extraordinary a degree, to
experience.</p>
<p>In the description I shall offer of the appearances of nature,
and of the various occurrences, during this winter, I know not
how I can do better than pursue a method similar to that
heretofore practised, by confining myself rather to the pointing
out of any difference observed in them now and formerly, than by
entering on a fresh description of the actual phenomena.&nbsp; To
those who read, as well as to those who describe, the account of
a winter passed in these regions can no longer be expected to
afford the interest of novelty it once possessed; more especially
in a station already delineated with tolerable geographical
precision on our maps, and thus, as it were, <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>brought near
to our firesides at home.&nbsp; Independently, indeed, of this
circumstance, it is hard to conceive any one thing more like
another than two winters passed in the higher latitudes of the
Polar regions, except when variety happens to be afforded by
intercourse with some other branch of &ldquo;the whole family of
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Winter after winter, nature here assumes an
aspect so much alike, that cursory observation can scarcely
detect a single feature of variety.&nbsp; The winter of more
temperate climates, and even in some of no slight severity, is
occasionally diversified by a thaw, which at once gives variety
and comparative cheerfulness to the prospect.&nbsp; But here,
when once the earth is covered, all is dreary, monotonous
whiteness&mdash;not merely for days or weeks, but for more than
half a year together.&nbsp; Whichever way the eye is turned, it
meets a picture calculated to impress upon the mind an idea of
inanimate stillness, of that motionless torpor with which our
feelings have nothing congenial; of anything, in short, but
life.&nbsp; In the very silence there is a deadness with which a
human spectator appears out of keeping.&nbsp; The presence of man
seems an intrusion on the dreary solitude of this wintry desert,
which even its native animals have for awhile forsaken.</p>
<p>As this general description of the aspect of nature would suit
alike each winter we have passed in the ice, so also, with very
little variation, might our limited catalogue of occurrences and
adventures serve equally for any one of those seasons.&nbsp;
Creatures of circumstance, we act and feel as we did before on
every like occasion, and as others will probably do after us in
the same situation.&nbsp; Whatever difference time or events may
have wrought in individual feelings, and however different the
occupations which those feelings may have suggested, <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>they
are not such as, without impertinence, can be intruded upon
others; with these &ldquo;the stranger intermeddleth
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am persuaded, therefore, that I shall be
excused in sparing the dulness of another winter&rsquo;s diary,
and confining myself exclusively to those facts which appear to
possess any scientific interest, to the few incidents which did
diversify our confinement, and to such remarks as may contribute
to the health and comfort of any future sojourners in these
dreary regions.</p>
<p>It may well be supposed that, in this climate, the principal
desideratum which art is called upon to furnish for the promotion
of health, is warmth, as well in the external air as in the
inhabited apartments.&nbsp; Exposure to a cold atmosphere, when
the body is well clothed, produces no bad effect whatever beyond
a frost-bitten cheek, nose, or finger.&nbsp; As for any injury to
healthy lungs from the breathing of cold air, or from sudden
changes from this into a warm atmosphere, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>, it may with much confidence be asserted that,
with due attention to external clothing, there is nothing in this
respect to be apprehended.&nbsp; This inference, at least, would
appear legitimate, from the fact that our crews, consisting of
one hundred and twenty persons, have for four winters been
constantly undergoing, for months together, a change of from
eighty to a hundred degrees of temperature, in the space of time
required for opening two doors (perhaps less than half a minute),
without incurring any pulmonary complaints at all.&nbsp; Nor is a
covering for the mouth at all necessary under these
circumstances, though to most persons very conducive to comfort;
for some individuals, from extreme dislike to the condensation
and freezing of the breath about the &ldquo;comforter&rdquo;
generally used for this purpose, have never <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>worn any such
defence for the mouth; and this without the slightest injurious
effect or uncomfortable feeling beyond that of a cold face, which
becomes comparatively trifling by habit.</p>
<p>In speaking of the external clothing sufficient for health in
this climate, it must be confessed that, in severe exposure,
quite a load of woollen clothes, even of the best quality, is
insufficient to retain a comfortable degree of warmth; a strong
breeze carrying it off so rapidly that the sensation is that of
the cold piercing through the body.&nbsp; A jacket made very
long, like those called by seamen &ldquo;pea-jackets,&rdquo; and
lined with fur throughout, would be more effectual than twice the
weight of woollen clothes, and is indeed almost
weather-proof.&nbsp; For the prevention of lumbago, to which our
seamen are especially liable, from their well-known habit of
leaving their loins imperfectly clothed, every man should be
strictly obliged to wear, under his outer clothes, a canvas belt
a foot broad, lined with flannel, and having straps to go over
the shoulder.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that no precautions in clothing are
sufficient to maintain health during a Polar winter, without a
due degree of warmth in the apartments we inhabit.&nbsp; Most
persons are apt to associate with the idea of warmth, something
like the comfort derived from a good fire on a winter&rsquo;s
evening at home; but in these regions the case is inconceivably
different: here it is not simple comfort, but health, and
therefore ultimately life, that depends upon it.&nbsp; The want
of a constant supply of warmth is here immediately followed by a
condensation of all the moisture, whether from the breath,
victuals, or other sources, into abundant drops of water, very
rapidly forming on all the coldest parts of the deck.&nbsp; A
still <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>lower temperature modifies, and
perhaps improves the annoyance by converting it into ice, which
again an occasional increase of warmth dissolves into
water.&nbsp; Nor is this the amount of the evil, though it is the
only visible part of it; for not only is a moist atmosphere thus
incessantly kept up, but it is rendered stagnant also by the want
of that ventilation which warmth alone can furnish.&nbsp; With an
apartment in this state, the men&rsquo;s clothes and bedding are
continually in a moist and unwholesome condition, generating a
deleterious air, which there is no circulation to carry off; and
whenever these circumstances combine for any length of time
together, so surely may the scurvy, to say nothing of other
diseases, be confidently expected to exhibit itself.</p>
<p>With a strong conviction of these facts, arising from the
extreme anxiety with which I have been accustomed to watch every
minute circumstance connected with the health of our people, it
may be conceived how highly I must appreciate any means that can
be devised to counteract effects so pernicious.&nbsp; Such means
have been completely furnished by Mr. Sylvester&rsquo;s warming
apparatus&mdash;a contrivance of which I scarcely know how to
express my admiration in adequate terms.&nbsp; The alteration
adopted on this voyage, of placing this stove in the very bottom
of the hold, produced not only the effect naturally to be
expected from it, of increasing the rapidity of the current of
warm air, and thus carrying it to all the officers&rsquo; cabins
with less loss of heat in its passage; but was also accompanied
by an advantage scarcely less important, which had <i>not</i>
been anticipated.&nbsp; This was the perfect and uniform warmth
maintained during the winter in both cable-tiers, which, when
cleared of all the stores, gave us another habitable deck, on
which more <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>than one-third of the men&rsquo;s
hammocks were berthed, thus affording to the ships&rsquo;
companies, during seven or eight months of the year, the
indescribable comfort of nearly twice the space for their beds,
and twice the volume of air to breathe in.&nbsp; It need scarcely
be added, how conducive to wholesome ventilation, and to the
prevention of moisture below, such an arrangement proved; suffice
it to say, that we have never before been so free from moisture,
and that I cannot but chiefly attribute to this apparatus the
unprecedented good state of health we enjoyed during this
winter.</p>
<p>Every attention was, as usual, paid to the occupation and
diversion of the men&rsquo;s minds, as well as to the regularity
of their bodily exercise.&nbsp; Our former amusements being
almost worn threadbare, it required some ingenuity to devise any
plan that should possess the charm of novelty to recommend
it.&nbsp; This purpose was completely answered, however, by a
proposal of Captain Hoppner, to attempt a masquerade, in which
officers and men should alike take part, but which, without
imposing any restraint whatever, would leave every one to their
own choice, whether to join in this diversion or not.&nbsp; It is
impossible that any idea could have proved more happy or more
exactly suited to our situation.&nbsp; Admirably dressed
characters of various descriptions readily took their parts, and
many of these were supported with a degree of spirit and genuine
humour which would not have disgraced a more refined assembly;
while the latter might not have disdained, and would not have
been disgraced by copying the good order, decorum, and
inoffensive cheerfulness which our humble masquerades
presented.&nbsp; It does especial credit to the dispositions and
good sense of our men that, though all the officers entered <!--
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>fully into the spirit of these amusements, which took
place once a month alternately on board each ship, no instance
occurred of anything that could interfere with the regular
discipline, or at all weaken the respect of the men towards their
superiors.&nbsp; Ours were masquerades without
licentiousness&mdash;carnivals without excess.</p>
<p>But an occupation not less assiduously pursued, and of
infinitely more eventual benefit, was furnished by the
re-establishment of our schools, under the voluntary
superintendence of my friend Mr. Hooper in the <i>Hecla</i>, and
of Mr. Mogg in the <i>Fury</i>.&nbsp; By the judicious zeal of
Mr. Hooper, the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> school was made subservient,
not merely to the improvement of the men in reading and writing
(in which, however, their progress was surprisingly great), but
also to the cultivation of that religious feeling which so
essentially improves the character of a seaman, by furnishing the
highest motives for increased attention to every other
duty.&nbsp; Nor was the benefit confined to the eighteen or
twenty individuals whose want of scholarship brought them to the
school-table, but extended itself to the rest of the ship&rsquo;s
company, making the whole lower-deck such a scene of quiet,
rational occupation as I never before witnessed on board a
ship.&nbsp; And I do not speak lightly, when I express my
thorough persuasion that to the moral effects thus produced upon
the minds of the men were owing, in a very high degree, the
constant yet sober cheerfulness, the uninterrupted good order,
and even, in some measure, the extraordinary state of health
which prevailed among us during this winter.</p>
<p>Immediately after the ships were finally secured, we erected
the observatory on shore, and commenced our arrangements for the
various observations to which our <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>attention was
to be directed during the winter.&nbsp; The interest of these,
especially of such as related to magnetism, increased so much as
we proceeded, that the neighbourhood of the observatory assumed
ere long almost the appearance of a scattered village, the number
of detached houses, having various needles set up in them, soon
amounting to seven or eight.</p>
<p>The extreme facility with which sounds are heard at a
considerable distance in severely cold weather has often been a
subject of remark; but a circumstance occurred at Port Bowen
which deserves to be noticed, as affording a sort of measure of
this facility, or at least conveying to others some definite idea
of the fact.&nbsp; Lieutenant Foster, having occasion to send a
man from the observatory to the opposite shore of the harbour, a
measured distance of 6696 feet, or about one statute mile and
two-tenths, in order to fix a meridian mark, had placed a second
person half-way between to repeat his directions; but he found,
on trial, that this precaution was unnecessary, as he could
without difficulty keep up a conversation with the man at the
distant station.&nbsp; The thermometer was at this time -18&deg;,
the barometer 30.14 inches, and the weather nearly calm, and
quite clear and serene.</p>
<p>The meteorological phenomena observed during this winter, like
most of its other occurrences, differed so little in character
from those noticed on the former voyages, as to render a separate
description of each wholly unnecessary.</p>
<p>This winter certainly afforded but few brilliant displays of
the Aurora.&nbsp; The following notice includes all that appear
to me to require a separate description.</p>
<p>Late on the night of the 21st of December the phenomenon
appeared partially, and with a variable light, <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>in different
parts of the southern sky for several hours.&nbsp; At seven on
the following morning it became more brilliant and stationary,
describing a well-defined arch, extending from the E.S.E. horizon
to that at W.N.W., and passing through the zenith.&nbsp; A very
faint arch was also visible on each side of this, appearing to
diverge from the same points in the horizon, and separating to
twenty degrees distance in the zenith.&nbsp; It remained thus for
twenty minutes, when the coruscations from each arch met, and
after a short but brilliant display of light, gradually died
away.&nbsp; Early on the morning of the 15th of January, 1825,
the Aurora broke out to the southward, and continued variable for
three hours, between a N.W. and S.E. bearing.&nbsp; From three to
four o&rsquo;clock the whole horizon, from south to west, was
brilliantly illuminated, the light being continuous almost
throughout the whole extent, and reaching several degrees in
height.&nbsp; Very bright vertical rays were constantly shooting
upwards from the general mass.&nbsp; At half-past five it again
became so brilliant as to attract particular notice, describing
two arches passing in an east and west direction, very near the
zenith, with bright coruscations issuing from it; but the whole
gradually disappeared with the returning dawn.&nbsp; At dusk the
same evening, the Aurora again appeared in the southern quarter,
and continued visible nearly the whole night, but without any
remarkable feature.</p>
<p>About midnight on the 27th of January, this phenomenon broke
out in a single compact mass of brilliant yellow light, situated
about a S.E. bearing, and appearing only a short distance above
the land.&nbsp; This mass of light, notwithstanding its general
continuity, sometimes appeared to be evidently composed of
numerous pencils of <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>rays, compressed, as it were,
laterally into one, its limits both to the right and left being
well defined and nearly vertical.&nbsp; The light, though very
bright at all times, varied almost constantly in intensity, and
this had the appearance (not an uncommon one in the Aurora) of
being produced by one volume of light overlaying another, just as
we see the darkness and density of smoke increased by cloud
rolling over cloud.&nbsp; While Lieutenants Sherer and Ross, and
myself, were admiring the extreme beauty of this phenomenon from
the observatory, we all simultaneously uttered an exclamation of
surprise at seeing a bright ray of the Aurora shoot suddenly
downward from the general mass of light, and between us and the
land, which was there distant only three thousand yards.&nbsp;
Had I witnessed this phenomenon by myself, I should have been
disposed to receive with caution the evidence even of my own
senses, as to this last fact; but the appearance conveying
precisely the same idea to three individuals at once, all
intently engaged in looking towards the spot, I have no doubt
that the ray of light actually passed within that distance of
us.</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 23rd of
February, the Aurora again appeared over the hills in a south
direction, presenting a brilliant mass of light, very similar to
that just described.&nbsp; The rolling motion of the light
laterally was here also very striking, as well as the increase of
its intensity thus occasioned.&nbsp; The light occupied
horizontally about a point of the compass, and extended in height
scarcely a degree above the land, which seemed, however, to
conceal from us a part of the phenomenon.&nbsp; It was always
evident enough that the most attenuated light of the Aurora
sensibly dimmed the <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>stars, like a thin veil drawn over
them.&nbsp; We frequently listened for any sound proceeding from
this phenomenon, but never heard any.&nbsp; Our
variation-needles, which were extremely light, suspended in the
most delicate manner, and from the weak directive energy
susceptible of being acted upon by a very slight disturbing
force, were never in a single instance sensibly affected by the
Aurora, which could scarcely fail to have been observed at some
time or other, had any such disturbance taken place, the needles
being visited every hour for several months, and oftener, when
anything occurred to make it desirable.</p>
<p>The meteors called Falling-stars were much more frequent
during this winter than we ever before saw them, and particularly
during the month of December.&nbsp; On the 8th, at a quarter past
seven in the evening, a particularly large and brilliant meteor
of this kind fell in the S.S.W., the weather being very fine and
clear overhead, but hazy near the horizon.&nbsp; On the following
day, between four and five P.M., another very brilliant one was
observed in the north, falling from an altitude of about
thirty-five degrees till lost behind the land; the weather was at
this time clear and serene, and no remarkable change took
place.&nbsp; On the 12th, no less than five meteors of this kind
were observed in a quarter of an hour, and as these were attended
with some remarkable circumstances, I shall here give the account
furnished me by Mr. Ross, who with Mr. Bell observed these
phenomena.&nbsp; &ldquo;From seven to nine P.M. the wind suddenly
increased from a moderate breeze to a strong gale from the
southward.&nbsp; At ten it began to moderate a little; the haze,
which had for several hours obscured every star, gradually
sinking towards the horizon, and by <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>eleven
o&rsquo;clock the whole atmosphere was extremely clear above the
altitude of five or six degrees.&nbsp; The thermometer also fell
from -5&deg; to -9&deg; as the haze cleared away.&nbsp; At a
quarter past eleven my attention was directed by Mr. Bell to some
meteors which he observed, and in less than a quarter of an hour
five were seen.&nbsp; The two first, noticed only by Mr. Bell,
fell in quick succession, probably not more than two minutes
apart.&nbsp; The third appeared about eight minutes after these,
and exceeded in brilliancy any of the surrounding stars.&nbsp; It
took a direction from near &beta; Tauri, and passing slowly
towards the Pleiades, left behind it sparks like the tail of a
rocket, these being visible for a few seconds after the meteor
appeared to break, which it did close to the Pleiades.&nbsp; The
fourth meteor made its appearance very near the same place as the
last, and about five minutes after it.&nbsp; Taking the course of
those seen by Mr. Bell, it passed to the eastward, and
disappeared half way between &beta; Tauri and Gemini.&nbsp; The
fifth of these meteors was seen to the eastward, passing through
a space of about five degrees from north to south parallel to the
horizon, and moving along the upper part of the cloud of haze
which still extended to the altitude of five or six
degrees.&nbsp; It was more dim than the rest, and of a red colour
like Aldebaran.&nbsp; The third of these meteors was the only one
that left a tail behind it, as above described.&nbsp; There was a
faint appearance of the Aurora to the westward near the
horizon.</p>
<p>On the 14th of December several very bright meteors were
observed to fall between the hours of five and six in the
evening, at which time the wind freshened from the N.W. by N. in
a very remarkable manner.&nbsp; On this occasion, as well as on
the 12th of December, there <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>appeared to
be an evident coincidence between the occurrence of the meteors
and the changes of the weather at the time.</p>
<p>Particular attention was paid to the changes in the barometer
during this winter, to which much encouragement was given by the
excellence of the instruments with which we were now
furnished.&nbsp; The times of register at sea had been three and
nine, A.M. and P.M.; those hours having been recommended as the
most proper for detecting any horary oscillations of the
mercurial column.&nbsp; When we were fixed for the winter, and
our attention could be more exclusively devoted to scientific
objects, the register was extended to four and ten, and
subsequently to five and eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The most
rigid attention to the observation and correction of the column,
during several months, discovered an oscillation amounting only
to ten thousandth-parts of an inch.&nbsp; The times of the
maximum and minimum altitude appear, however, decidedly to lean
to four and ten o&rsquo;clock, and to follow a law directly the
reverse, as to time, of that found to obtain in temperate
climates, the column being highest at four, and lowest at ten
o&rsquo;clock, both A.M. and P.M.</p>
<p>The barometer did not appear to indicate beforehand the
changes of the weather with any degree of certainty.&nbsp; Indeed
the remark that we had always before made, that alterations in
the mercurial column more frequently accompany than precede the
visible changes of weather in these regions, was equally true of
our present experience; but on one or two occasions hard gales of
considerable duration occurred without the barometer falling at
all below the mean altitude of the column in these regions, or
even rose steadily during the continuance of the gale.&nbsp; <!--
page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>During one week of almost constant blowing weather, and
two days of very violent gales from the eastward, in the month of
April, the barometer remained considerably above thirty inches
the whole time.&nbsp; It is necessary for me here to remark that
the unusual proportion of easterly winds registered in our
journals during this winter must, in my opinion, be attributed to
the local situation of our winter-quarters, which alone appears
to me sufficient to account for the anomaly.&nbsp; The lands on
each side of Port Bowen, running nearly east and west, and rising
to a height of six to nine hundred feet above the sea, with deep
and broad ravines intersecting the country in almost every
direction, may be supposed to have had considerable influence on
the direction of the wind.&nbsp; In confirmation of this
supposition, indeed, it was usually noticed that the easterly
winds were with us attended with clear weather, while the
contrary obtained with almost every breeze from the west and
north-west, thus reversing in this respect also the usual order
of things.&nbsp; It was moreover observed that the clouds were
frequently coming from the north-west, when the wind in Port
Bowen was easterly.&nbsp; I must, however, except the gales we
experienced from the eastward, which were probably strong enough
to overcome any local deflection to which a light breeze would be
subject; and indeed these were always accompanied with overcast
weather and a high thermometer.&nbsp; After the middle of October
the gales of wind were very few till towards the middle of April,
when we experienced more blowing weather than during the whole
winter.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Meteorological Phenomena
continued&mdash;Re-equipment of the Ships&mdash;Several Journeys
undertaken&mdash;Open Water in the Offing&mdash;Commence sawing a
Canal to liberate the Ships&mdash;Disruption of the
Ice&mdash;Departure from Port Bowen.</p>
<p>The height of the land about Port Bowen deprived us longer
than usual of the sun&rsquo;s presence above our horizon.&nbsp;
Some of our gentlemen, indeed, who ascended a high hill for the
purpose, caught a glimpse of him on the 2nd of February; on the
15th it became visible at the observatory, but at the ships not
till the 22nd, after an absence of one hundred and twenty-one
days.&nbsp; It is very long after the sun&rsquo;s reappearance in
these regions, however, that the effect of his rays, as to
warmth, becomes perceptible; week passes after week with scarcely
any rise in the thermometer except for an hour or two during the
day; and it is at this period more than any other, perhaps, that
the lengthened duration of a polar winter&rsquo;s cold is most
wearisome, and creates the most impatience.&nbsp; Towards the
third week in March, thin flakes of snow lying upon black painted
wood or metal, and exposed to the sun&rsquo;s direct rays in a
sheltered situation, readily melted.&nbsp; In the second week of
April any very light covering of sand or ashes upon the snow
close to the ships might be observed to make its way downward
into holes; but a coat of sand laid upon the unsheltered ice, to
the distance of about two-thirds of a mile, for dissolving a
canal to hasten our liberation, produced no such sensible effect
till the beginning of May.&nbsp; Even then the dissolution was
very trifling till about the first week in June, when pools of
water began to make their appearance, and not long <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>after
this a small boat would have floated down it.&nbsp; On shore the
effect is in general still more tardy, though some deception is
there occasioned by the dissolution of the snow next the ground,
while its upper surface is to all appearance undergoing little or
no change.&nbsp; Thus a greater alteration is sometimes produced
in the aspect of the land by a single warm day in an advanced
part of the season than in many weeks preceding, in consequence
of the last crust of snow being dissolved, leaving the ground at
length entirely bare.&nbsp; We could now perceive the snow
beginning to leave the stones from day to day as early as the
last week in April.&nbsp; Towards the end of May a great deal of
snow was dissolved daily, but owing to the porous nature of the
ground, which absorbed it as fast as it was formed, it was not
easy to procure water for drinking on shore, even as late as the
10th of June.&nbsp; In the ravines, however, it could be heard
trickling under stones before that time, and about the 18th, many
considerable streams were formed, and constantly running both
night and day.&nbsp; After this, the thawing proceeded at an
inconceivably rapid rate, the whole surface of the floes being
covered with large pools of water rapidly increasing in size and
depth.</p>
<p>We observed nothing extraordinary with respect to the
sun&rsquo;s light about the shortest day; but as early as the
20th of November Arcturus could very plainly be distinguished by
the naked eye, when near the south meridian at noon.&nbsp; About
the first week in April the reflection of light from the snow
became so strong as to create inflammation in the eyes, and
notwithstanding the usual precaution of wearing black crape veils
during exposure, several cases of snow-blindness occurred shortly
afterwards.</p>
<p>There are perhaps few things more difficult to obtain <!--
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>than a comparative measure of the quantity of snow that
falls at different places, owing to the facility with which the
wind blows it off a smooth surface, such as a floe of level ice,
and the collection occasioned by drift in consequence of the
smallest obstruction.&nbsp; Thus, its mean depth at Port Bowen,
measured in twenty different places on the smooth ice of the
harbour, was three inches on the 5th of April, and on the 1st of
May it had only increased to four and a half inches, while an
immense bank, fourteen feet deep, had formed on one side of the
<i>Hecla</i>, occasioned by the heavy drifts.&nbsp; The crystals
were, as usual, extremely minute during the continuance of the
cold weather, and more or less of these were always falling, even
on the clearest days.</p>
<p>The animals seen at Port Bowen may now be briefly
noticed.&nbsp; The principal of those seen during the winter were
bears, of which we killed twelve, from October to June, being
more than during all the other voyages taken together; and
several others were seen.&nbsp; One of these animals was near
proving fatal to a seaman of the <i>Fury</i>, who, having
straggled from his companions, when at the top of a high hill saw
a large bear coming towards him.&nbsp; Being unarmed, he
prudently made off, taking off his boots to enable him to run the
faster, but not so prudently precipitated himself over an almost
perpendicular cliff, down which he was said to have rolled or
fallen several hundred feet; here he was met by some of the
people in so lacerated a condition as to be in a very dangerous
state for some time after.</p>
<p>A she-bear, killed in the open water on our first arrival at
Port Bowen, afforded a striking instance of maternal affection in
her anxiety to save her two cubs.&nbsp; She might herself easily
have escaped the boat, but would not <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>forsake her
young, which she was actually &ldquo;towing&rdquo; off by
allowing them to rest on her back, when the boat came near
them.&nbsp; A second similar instance occurred in the spring,
when two cubs having got down into a large crack in the ice their
mother placed herself before them, so as to secure them from the
attacks of our people, which she might easily have avoided
herself.</p>
<p>This unusual supply of bear&rsquo;s flesh was particularly
serviceable as food for the Esquimaux dogs we had brought out,
and which were always at work in a sledge; especially as, during
the winter, our number was increased by the birth of six others
of these useful animals.</p>
<p>One or two foxes (<i>Canis Lagopus</i>) were killed, and four
caught in traps during the winter, weighing from four pounds and
three-quarters to three pounds and three-quarters.&nbsp; The
colour of one of these animals, which lived for some time on
board the <i>Fury</i> and became tolerably tame, was nearly pure
white till the month of May, when he shed his winter-coat and
became of a dirty chocolate colour, with two or three light brown
spots.&nbsp; Only three hares (<i>Lepus Variabilis</i>) were
killed from October to June, weighing from six to eight pounds
and three-quarters.&nbsp; Their fur was extremely thick, soft,
and of the most beautiful whiteness imaginable.&nbsp; We saw no
deer near Port Bowen at any season, neither were we visited by
their enemies the wolves.&nbsp; A single ermine and a few mice
(<i>Mus Hudsonius</i>) complete, I believe, our scanty list of
quadrupeds at this desolate and unproductive place.</p>
<p>Of birds, we had a flock or two of ducks occasionally flying
about the small lanes of open water in the offing, as late as the
3rd of October; but none from that time to the beginning of June,
and then only a single pair was <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>occasionally
seen.&nbsp; A very few grouse were met with also after our
arrival at Port Bowen; a single specimen was obtained on the 23rd
of December, and another on the 18th of February.&nbsp; They
again made their appearance towards the end of March, and in less
than a month about two hundred were killed; after which we
scarcely saw another, for what reason we could not conjecture,
except that they might possibly be on their way to the northward,
and that the utter barrenness of the land about Port Bowen
afforded no inducement for their remaining in our
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Ross, who paid great attention to ornithology,
remarked that the grouse met with here are of three kinds,
namely, the ptarmigan (<i>Tetrao Lagopus</i>), the rock-grouse,
(<i>Tetrao Rupestris</i>), and the willow-partridge (<i>Tetrao
Albus</i>).&nbsp; Of these only the two former were seen in the
spring, and by far the greater number killed were of the
first-mentioned species.&nbsp; They usually had in their maws the
leaves of the <i>Dryas Integrifolia</i>, buds of the <i>Saxifraga
Oppositifolia</i>, <i>Salix Arctica</i>, and <i>Draba Alpina</i>,
the quantities being according to the order in which the plants
have here been named.&nbsp; A few leaves also of the <i>Polygonum
Viviparum</i> were found in one or two specimens.&nbsp; The
snow-bunting, with its sprightly note, was, as usual, one of our
earliest visitants in the spring; but these were few in number
and remained only a short time.&nbsp; A very few sand-pipers were
also seen, and now and then one or two glaucous, ivory, and
kittiwake gulls.&nbsp; A pair of ravens appeared occasionally
during the whole winter here, as at most of our former winter
stations.</p>
<p>With a view to extend our geographical knowledge as much as
our means permitted, three land journeys were undertaken as soon
as the weather was sufficiently warm <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for procuring
any water.&nbsp; The first party, consisting of six men, under
Captain Hoppner, were instructed to travel to the eastward, to
endeavour to reach the sea in that direction and to discover the
communication which probably exists there with Admiralty Inlet,
so as to determine the extent of that portion of insular land on
which Port Bowen is situated.&nbsp; They returned on the 14th,
after a very fatiguing journey, and having with difficulty
travelled a degree and three-quarters to the eastward of the
ships, in latitude 73&deg; 19&prime;, from which position no
appearance of the sea could be perceived.&nbsp; Captain Hoppner
described the ravines as extremely difficult to pass, many of
them being four or five hundred feet deep and very
precipitous.&nbsp; These being numerous and running chiefly in a
north and south direction, appearing to empty themselves into
Jackson&rsquo;s Inlet, preclude the possibility of performing a
quick journey to the eastward.&nbsp; During the whole
fortnight&rsquo;s excursion scarcely a patch of vegetation could
be seen.&nbsp; Indeed, the hills were so covered in most parts
with soft and deep snow that a spot could seldom be found on
which to pitch their tent.&nbsp; A few snow-buntings and some
ivory gulls were all the animals they met with to enliven this
most barren and desolate country; and nothing was observed in the
geological character differing from that about Port Bowen.</p>
<p>In the bed of one of the ravines Captain Hoppner noticed some
immense masses of rock, thirty or forty tons in weight, which had
recently fallen from above, and he also passed over several
avalanches of snow piled to a vast height across it.</p>
<p>The two other parties, consisting of four men each, under the
respective commands of Lieutenants Sherer <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and Ross,
were directed to travel, the former to the southward, and the
latter to the northward, along the coast of Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Inlet, for the purpose of surveying it accurately, and of
obtaining observations for the longitude and variation at the
stations formerly visited by us on the 7th and 15th of August,
1819.&nbsp; I was also very anxious to ascertain the state of the
ice to the northward to enable me to form some judgment as to the
probable time of our liberation.</p>
<p>These parties found the travelling along shore so good as to
enable them not only to reach those spots, but to extend their
journeys far beyond them.&nbsp; Lieutenant Ross returning on the
15th, brought the welcome intelligence of the sea being perfectly
open and free from ice at the distance of twenty-two miles to the
northward of Port Bowen, by which I concluded&mdash;what, indeed,
had long before been a matter of probable conjecture,&mdash;that
Barrow&rsquo;s Strait was not permanently frozen during the
winter.&nbsp; From the tops of the hills about Cape York, beyond
which promontory Lieutenant Ross travelled, no appearance of ice
could be distinguished.&nbsp; Innumerable ducks, chiefly of the
king, eider, and long-tailed species, were flying about near the
margin of the ice, besides dovekies, looms, and glaucous,
kittiwake, and ivory gulls.&nbsp; Lieutenant Sherer returned to
the ships on the evening of the 15th, having performed a rapid
journey as far as 72&frac14;&deg;, and making an accurate survey
of the whole coast to that distance.&nbsp; In the course of this
journey a great many remains of Esquimaux habitations were seen,
and these were much more numerous on the southern part of the
coast.&nbsp; In a grave which Lieutenant Sherer opened, in order
to form some idea whether the Esquimaux had lately been here, he
found the body apparently quite <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>fresh; but as
this might in a northern climate remain the case for a number of
years, and as our board erected in 1819 was still standing
untouched and in good order, it is certain these people had not
been here since our former visit.&nbsp; Less numerous traces of
the Esquimaux, and of older date, occur near Port Bowen and in
Lieutenant Ross&rsquo;s route along shore to the northward, and a
few of the remains of habitations were those used as winter
residences.&nbsp; I have since regretted that Lieutenant Sherer
was not furnished with more provisions and a larger party to have
enabled him to travel round Cape Kater, which is probably not far
distant from some of the northern Esquimaux stations mentioned in
my Journal of the preceding voyage.</p>
<p>Towards the end of June, the dovekies (<i>Colymbus Grylle</i>)
were extremely numerous in the cracks of the ice at the entrance
of Port Bowen, and as these were the only fresh supply of any
consequence that we were able to procure at this unproductive
place, we were glad to permit the men to go out occasionally with
guns, after the ships were ready for sea, to obtain for their
messes this wholesome change of diet; while such excursions also
contributed essentially to their general health and
cheerfulness.&nbsp; Many hundreds of these birds were thus
obtained in the course of a few days.&nbsp; On the evening of the
6th of July, however, I was greatly shocked at being informed by
Captain Hoppner that John Cotterell, a seaman of the <i>Fury</i>,
had been found drowned in one of the cracks of the ice, by two
other men belonging to the same party who had been with him but a
few minutes before.&nbsp; We could never ascertain precisely in
what manner this accident happened, but it was supposed that he
must have overreached himself in stooping for a bird <!-- page
48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>that
he had killed.&nbsp; His remains were committed to the earth on
Sunday the 10th, with every solemnity which the occasion
demanded, and our situation would allow; and a tomb of stones
with a suitable inscription was afterwards erected over the
grave.</p>
<p>In order to obtain oil for another winter&rsquo;s consumption
before the ships could be released from the ice, and our
travelling parties having seen a number of black whales in the
open water to the northward, two boats from each ship were, with
considerable labour, transported four miles along shore in that
direction, to be in readiness for killing a whale and boiling the
oil on the beach, whenever the open water should approach
sufficiently near.&nbsp; They took their station near a
remarkable peninsular piece of land on the south side of the
entrance to Jackson&rsquo;s Inlet, which had on the former voyage
been taken for an island.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these
preparations, however, it was vexatious to find that on the 9th
of July the water was still three miles distant from the boats,
and at least seven from Port Bowen.&nbsp; On the 12th, the ice in
our neighbourhood began to detach itself, and the boats under the
command of Lieutenants Sherer and Ross being launched on the
following day, succeeded almost immediately in killing a small
whale of &ldquo;five feet bone,&rdquo; exactly answering our
purpose.&nbsp; Almost at the same time, and as it turned out very
opportunely, the ice at the mouth of our harbour detached itself
at an old crack, and drifted off, leaving only about one mile and
a quarter between us and the sea.&nbsp; Half of this distance
being occupied by the gravelled canal, which was dissolved quite
through the ice in many parts and had become very thin in all,
every officer and man in both ships were set to work without
delay to commence a fresh canal from the open water, to <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>communicate with the other.&nbsp; This work proved
heavier than we expected, the ice being generally from five to
eight feet, and in many places from ten to eleven, in
thickness.&nbsp; It was continued, however, with the greatest
cheerfulness and alacrity from seven in the morning till seven in
the evening daily, the dinner being prepared on the ice and eaten
under the lee of a studding sail erected as a tent.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th a very welcome stop was put to
our operations by the separation of the floe entirely across the
harbour, and about one-third from the ships to where we were at
work.&nbsp; All hands being instantly recalled by signal, were on
their return set to work to get the ships into the gravelled
canal, and to saw away what still remained in it to prevent our
warping to sea.&nbsp; This work, with only half an hour&rsquo;s
intermission for the men&rsquo;s supper, was continued till
half-past six the following morning, when we succeeded in getting
clear.&nbsp; The weather being calm, two hours were occupied in
towing the ships to sea, and thus the officers and men were
employed at very laborious work for twenty-six hours, during
which time there were, on one occasion, fifteen of them overboard
at once; and, indeed, several individuals met with the same
accident three times.&nbsp; It was impossible, however, to regret
the necessity of these comparatively trifling exertions,
especially as it was now evident that to have sawed our way out,
without any canal, would have required at least a fortnight of
heavy and fatiguing labour.</p>

Land&mdash;Fresh and repeated Obstructions from Ice&mdash;Both

<p><i>July</i> 20.&mdash;On standing out to sea, we sailed with a
light southerly wind towards the western shore of Prince
Regent&rsquo;s Inlet, which it was my first wish to gain, on
account of the evident advantage to be derived from coasting the
southern part of that portion of land called in the chart
&ldquo;North Somerset,&rdquo; as far as it might lead to the
westward; which, from our former knowledge, we had reason to
suppose it would do as far at least as the longitude of 95&deg;,
in the parallel of about 72&deg;.&nbsp; After sailing about eight
miles, we were stopped by a body of close ice lying between us
and a space of open water beyond.&nbsp; By way of occupying the
time in further examination of the state of the ice, we then bore
up with a light northerly wind, and ran to the south-eastward to
see if there was any clear water between the ice and the land in
that direction; but found that there was no opening between them
to the southward of the flat-topped hill laid down in the chart,
and now called Mount Sherer.&nbsp; Indeed, I believe that at this
time the ice had not yet detached itself from the land to the
southward of that station.&nbsp; On standing back, we were
shortly after enveloped in one of the thick fogs which had, for
several weeks past, been observed almost daily hanging over some
part of the sea in the offing, though we had scarcely experienced
any in Port Bowen until the water became open at the mouth of the
harbour.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>On the clearing up of the fog on the 21st, we could
perceive no opening of the ice leading towards the western land;
nor any appearance of the smallest channel to the southward along
the eastern shore.&nbsp; I was determined, therefore, to try at
once a little farther to the northward, the present state of the
ice appearing completely to accord with that observed in 1819,
its breadth increasing as we advanced from Prince Leopold&rsquo;s
Islands to the southward.&nbsp; As, therefore, I felt confident
of being able to push along the shore if we should once gain it,
I was anxious to effect the latter object in any part rather than
incur the risk of hampering the ships by a vain, or, at least, a
doubtful attempt to force them through a body of close ice
several miles wide, for the sake of a few leagues of southing,
which would soon be regained by coasting.</p>
<p>Light winds detained us very much, but being at length
favoured by a breeze, we carried all sail to the north-west, the
ice very gradually leading us towards the Leopold Isles.&nbsp;
Having arrived off the northernmost on the morning of the 22nd,
it was vexatious, however curious, to observe the exact
coincidence of the present position of the ice with that which it
occupied a little later in the year 1819.&nbsp; The whole body of
it seemed to cling to the western shore, as if held there by some
strong attraction, forbidding, for the present, any access to
it.&nbsp; We now stood off and on, in the hope that a southerly
breeze, which had just sprung up, might serve to open us a
channel.&nbsp; In the evening the wind gradually freshened, and
before midnight had increased to a strong gale, which blew with
considerable violence for ten hours, obliging us to haul off from
the ice and to keep in smooth water under the eastern land until
it abated; after which not a moment was lost in again standing
over to the westward.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>After running
all night, with light and variable winds, through loose and
scattered ice, we suddenly found ourselves, on the clearing up of
a thick fog, through which we had been sailing on the morning of
the 24th, within one-third of a mile of Cape Seppings, the land
just appearing above the fog in time to save us from danger, the
soundings being thirty-eight fathoms, on a rocky bottom.&nbsp;
The <i>Fury</i> being apprised by guns of our situation, both
ships were hauled off the land, and the fog soon after
dispersing, we had the satisfaction to perceive that the late
gale had blown the ice off the land, leaving us a fine navigable
channel from one to two miles wide, as far as we could see from
the mast-head along the shore.&nbsp; We were able to avail
ourselves of this but slowly, however, in consequence of a light
southerly breeze still blowing against us.</p>
<p>We had now an opportunity of discovering that a long neck of
very low land runs out from the southernmost of the Leopold
Islands, and another from the shore to the southward of Cape
Clarence.&nbsp; These two had every appearance of joining, so as
to make a peninsula, instead of an island, of that portion of
land which, on account of our distance preventing our seeing the
low beach, had in 1819 been considered under the latter
character.&nbsp; It is, however, still somewhat doubtful, and the
Leopold Isles, therefore, still retain their original designation
on the chart.&nbsp; The land here, when closely viewed, assumes a
very striking and magnificent character, the strata of limestone,
which are numerous and quite horizontally disposed, being much
more regular than on the eastern shore of Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Inlet, and retaining nearly their whole perpendicular height of
six or seven hundred feet, close to the sea.&nbsp; The
south-eastern promontory of the southernmost <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>island is
particularly picturesque and beautiful, the heaps of loose
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> lying here and there up and down the sides
of the cliff giving it the appearance of some huge and
impregnable fortress, with immense buttresses of masonry
supporting the walls.&nbsp; Near Cape Seppings, and some distance
beyond it to the southward, we noticed a narrow stratum of some
very white substance, the nature of which we could not at this
time conjecture.&nbsp; I may here remark that the whole of
Barrow&rsquo;s Strait, as far as we could see to the N.N.E. of
the islands, was entirely free from ice; and from whatever
circumstance it may proceed, I do not think that this part of the
Polar Sea is at any season very much encumbered with it.</p>
<p>It was the general feeling, at this period, among us, that the
voyage had but now commenced.&nbsp; The labours of a bad summer,
and the tedium of a long winter, were forgotten in a moment when
we found ourselves upon ground not hitherto explored, and with
every apparent prospect before us of making as rapid a progress
as the nature of this navigation will permit towards the final
accomplishment of our object.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 25th, we passed the opening in the
land delineated in the former chart of this coast, in latitude
73&deg; 34&prime;, which we now found to be a bay about three
miles deep, but apparently open to the sea.&nbsp; I named it
after my friend, Hastings Elwin, Esq., of Bristol, as a token of
grateful esteem for that gentleman.&nbsp; The wind falling very
light, so that the ships made no progress, I took the opportunity
of landing in the fore-noon, accompanied by a party of the
officers, and was soon after joined by Captain Hoppner.&nbsp; We
found the formation to consist wholly of lime, and now discovered
the nature of the narrow white stratum observed the day <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>before from the offing, and which proved to be gypsum,
mostly of the earthy kind, and some of it of a very pure
white.&nbsp; A part of the rock near our landing-place contained
a quantity of it in the state of selenite in beautiful
transparent lamin&aelig; of a large size.&nbsp; The abundance of
gypsum hereabouts explained also the extreme whiteness of the
water near the whole of this part of the coast, which had always
been observed in approaching it, and which had at first excited
unnecessary apprehensions as to the soundings along the
shore.&nbsp; This colour is more particularly seen near the
mouths of the streams, many of which are quite of a dirty milk
colour, and tinge the sea to the distance of more than a mile,
without any alteration in the depth, except a gradual diminution
in going in.&nbsp; The vegetation in this place was, as usual,
extremely scanty, though much more luxuriant than on any of the
land near our winter quarters, and no animals were seen.&nbsp;
The latitude of our landing-place was 73&deg; 27&prime;
23&Prime;, the longitude by chronometers 90&deg; 50&prime;
34.6&Prime;, and the variation of the magnetic needle 125&deg;
34&prime; 42&Prime; westerly.&nbsp; From half-past nine A.M. till
a quarter past noon the tide fell two feet three inches; and as
it was nearly stationary at the latter time, it was probably near
low water.</p>
<p>A breeze enabling us again to make some progress, and an open
channel still favouring us of nearly the same breadth as before,
we passed during the night a second bay, about the same size as
the other, and also appearing open to the sea; it lies in
latitude (by account from the preceding and following noon)
73&deg; 19&prime; 30&Prime;, and its width is one mile and a
half.&nbsp; It was called Batty Bay, after my friend Captain
Robert Batty, of the Grenadier Guards.&nbsp; We now perceived
that the ice closed completely in with <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the land a
short distance beyond us, and having made all the way we could,
were obliged to stand off and on during the day in a channel not
three-quarters of a mile wide.&nbsp; This channel being still
more contracted towards the evening, we were obliged to make fast
to some grounded land ice upon the beach in four fathoms water,
there to await some change in our favour.&nbsp; We here observed
traces of our old friends the Esquimaux, there being several of
their circles of stones, though not of recent date, close to the
sea.&nbsp; We also found a more abundant vegetation than before,
and several plants familiar to us on the former voyages, but not
yet procured on this, were now added to our collections.&nbsp;
The geological character of the land was nearly the same as
before, but we found here some gypsum of the fibrous kind,
occurring in a single stratum about an inch and a half
wide.&nbsp; About a mile to the north of us was a curious cascade
or spout of water, issuing from a chasm in the rock, and falling
more than two hundred feet perpendicular.&nbsp; Our gentlemen,
who visited the spot, described it as rendered the more
picturesque by innumerable kittiwakes having their nests among
the rocks, and constantly flying about the stream.&nbsp; The
latitude was 73&deg; 06&prime; 17&Prime;, the longitude by
chronometers 91&deg; 19&prime; 52.3&Prime;, the dip of the
magnetic needle 88&deg; 02.1&prime;, and the variation 128&deg;
23&prime; 17&Prime; westerly.</p>
<p>The ice opening in the afternoon of the 27th, we cast off and
run four or five miles with a northerly breeze.&nbsp; This wind,
however, always had the effect of making the ice close the shore,
while a southerly breeze as uniformly opened it, so that on this
coast, as on several others that I have known, a contrary
wind&mdash;however great the paradox may seem&mdash;proved, on
the whole, the most favourable for making progress.&nbsp; This
circumstance is simply to be <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>attributed to
the greater abundance of open water in the parts we have left
behind (in the present instance the open sea of Barrow&rsquo;s
Strait) than those towards which we are going.&nbsp; We were once
more obliged to make fast, therefore, to some grounded ice close
to the beach, rather than run any risk of hampering the ships,
and rendering them unable to take advantage of a change in our
favour.</p>
<p>A light southerly breeze on the morning of the 28th gradually
cleared the shore, and a fresh wind from the N.W. then
immediately succeeded.&nbsp; We instantly took advantage of this
circumstance, and casting off at six A.M. ran eight or nine miles
without obstruction, when we were stopped by the ice, which, in a
closely packed and impenetrable body, stretched close into the
shore as far as the eye could reach from the crow&rsquo;s
nest.&nbsp; Being anxious to gain every foot of distance that we
could, and perceiving some grounded ice which appeared favourable
for making fast to, just at a point where the clear water
terminated, the ships were run to the utmost extent of it, and a
boat prepared from each to examine the depth of water at the
intended anchoring place.&nbsp; Just as I was about to leave the
<i>Hecla</i> for that purpose, the ice was observed to be in
rapid motion towards the shore.&nbsp; The <i>Fury</i> was
immediately hauled in by some grounded masses, and placed to the
best advantage; but the <i>Hecla</i> being more advanced was
immediately beset in spite of every exertion, and after breaking
two of the largest ice-anchors in endeavouring to heave in to the
shore, was obliged to drift with the ice, several masses of which
had fortunately interposed themselves between us and the
land.&nbsp; The ice slackening around us a little in the evening,
we were enabled, with considerable labour, to get to some
grounded masses, where we lay much exposed, as the <!-- page
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span><i>Fury</i> also did.&nbsp; In this situation, our
latitude being 72&deg; 51&prime; 51&Prime;, we saw a
comparatively low point of land three or four leagues to the
southward, which proved to be near that which terminated our view
of this coast in 1819.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the ice being slack for a short distance, we
shifted the <i>Hecla</i> half a mile to the northward, into a
less insecure berth.&nbsp; I then walked to a broad valley facing
the sea near us, where a considerable stream discharged itself,
and where, in passing in the ships, a large fish had been
observed to jump out of the water.&nbsp; In hopes of finding
salmon here, we tried for some time with several hand-nets, but
nothing was caught or seen.&nbsp; In this place were a number of
the Esquimaux stone circles, apparently of very old date, being
quite overgrown with grass, moss, and other plants.&nbsp; In the
neighbourhood of these habitations the vegetation was much more
luxuriant than anything of the kind we had seen before during
this voyage.&nbsp; The state of this year&rsquo;s plants was now
very striking, compared with those of the last, and afforded
strong evidence, if any had been wanting, of the difference
between the two seasons.&nbsp; I was particularly struck with the
appearance of some moss collected by Mr. Hooper, who pointed out
to me upon the same specimen the last year&rsquo;s miserable
seeds just peeping above the leaves, while those of the present
summer had already shot three-quarters of an inch beyond
them.&nbsp; Another circumstance which we noticed about this
time, and still more so as the season advanced, was the rapid
progress which the warmth had already made in dissolving the last
year&rsquo;s snow, this being always easily known by its dingy
colour, and its admixture with the soil.&nbsp; Of the past
winter&rsquo;s snow not a particle could be seen at the close of
July on any part of <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>this coast.&nbsp; These facts,
together with the beautiful weather we had enjoyed for many weeks
past, all tended to show that we were now favoured with an
unusually fine summer.&nbsp; We found in this place, in the dry
bed of an old stream, innumerable fossils in the limestone,
principally shells and madrepore.&nbsp; On a hill abreast of the
<i>Hecla</i>, and at an elevation of not less than three or four
hundred feet above the sea, one particular spot was discovered in
which the same kind of shells first found in Barrow&rsquo;s
Strait in 1819 occurred in very great abundance and perfection,
wholly detached from the lime in which for the most part they
were found embedded in other places on this coast.&nbsp; Indeed,
it was quite astonishing, in looking at the numberless fossil
animal remains occurring in many of the stones, to consider the
countless myriads of shell fish and marine insects which must
once have existed on this shore.&nbsp; The cliffs next the sea,
which here rise to a perpendicular height of between four and
five hundred feet, were continually breaking down at this season,
and adding, by falls of large masses of stone, to the slope of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> lying at their foot.&nbsp; The ships lay so
close to the shore as to be almost within the range of some of
these tumbling masses, there being at high water scarcely beach
enough for a person to walk along the shore.&nbsp; The time of
high water, near the opposition of the moon this night, was
between half-past eleven and midnight, being nearly the same as
at Port Bowen at full and change.</p>
<p>The ice opening for a mile and a half along shore on the 30th,
we shifted the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> berth about that distance to
the southward, chiefly to be enabled to see more distinctly round
a point which before obstructed our view, though our situation,
as regarded the security of the ship, was much altered for the
worse.&nbsp; The <i>Fury</i> remained <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>where she
was, there being no second berth even so good as the bad one
where she was now lying.&nbsp; In the afternoon it blew a hard
gale, with constant rain, from the northward, the clouds
indicating an easterly wind in other parts.&nbsp; This wind,
which was always the troublesome one to us, soon brought the ice
closer and closer, till it pressed with very considerable
violence on both ships, though the most upon the <i>Fury</i>,
which lay in a very exposed situation.&nbsp; The <i>Hecla</i>
received no damage but the breaking of two or three hawsers, and
a part of her bulwark torn away by the strain upon them.&nbsp; In
the course of the night we had reason to suppose, by the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> heeling, that she was either on shore, or
still heavily pressed by the ice from without.&nbsp; Early on the
morning of the 31st, as soon as a communication could be
effected, Captain Hoppner sent to inform me that the <i>Fury</i>
had been forced on the ground, where she still lay; but that she
would probably be hove off without much difficulty at high water,
provided the external ice did not prevent it.&nbsp; I also
learned from Captain Hoppner that a part of one of the propelling
wheels had been destroyed, the chock through which its axis
passed being forced in considerably, and the palm broken off one
of the bower anchors.&nbsp; Most of this damage, however, was
either of no very material importance, or could easily be
repaired.&nbsp; A large party of hands from the <i>Hecla</i>
being sent round to the <i>Fury</i> towards high water, she came
off the ground with very little strain, so that, upon the whole,
considering the situation in which the ships were lying, we
thought ourselves fortunate in having incurred no very serious
injury.&nbsp; The <i>Fury</i> was shifted a few yards into the
best place that could be found, and the wind again blowing strong
from the northward, the ice remained <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>close about
us.&nbsp; A shift of wind to the southward in the afternoon at
length began gradually to slacken it, but it was not till six
A.M. on the 1st of August that there appeared a prospect of
making any progress.&nbsp; There was, at this time, a great deal
of water to the southward, but between us and the channel there
lay one narrow and not very close stream of ice touching the
shore.&nbsp; A shift of wind to the northward determined me at
once to take advantage of it, as nothing but a free wind seemed
requisite to enable us to reach this promising channel.&nbsp; The
signal to that effect was immediately made, but while the sails
were setting, the ice, which had at first been about
three-quarters of a mile distant from us, was observed to be
closing the shore.&nbsp; The ships were cast with all expedition,
in hopes of gaining the broader channel before the ice had time
to shut us up.&nbsp; So rapid, however, was the latter in this
its sudden movement, that we had but just got the ships&rsquo;
heads the right way, when the ice came bodily in upon us, being
doubtless set in motion by a very sudden freshening of the wind
almost to a gale in the course of a few minutes.&nbsp; The ships
were now almost instantly beset, and in such a manner as to be
literally helpless and unmanageable.&nbsp; In such cases, it must
be confessed that the exertions made by heaving at hawsers or
otherwise are of little more service than in the occupation they
furnish to the men&rsquo;s minds under circumstances of
difficulty; for when the ice is fairly acting against the ship,
ten times the strength and ingenuity could in reality avail
nothing.</p>
<p>The sails were, however, kept set, and as the body of ice was
setting to the southward withal, we went with it some little
distance in that direction.&nbsp; The <i>Hecla</i> after thus
driving, and now and then forcing her way through <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the
ice, in all about three-quarters of a mile, quite close to the
shore, at length struck the ground forcibly several times in the
space of a hundred yards, and being then brought up by it
remained immovable, the depth of water under her keel abaft being
sixteen feet, or about a foot less than she drew.&nbsp; The
<i>Fury</i> continuing to drive was now irresistibly carried past
us, and we escaped, only by a few feet, the damage invariably
occasioned by ships coming in contact under such
circumstances.&nbsp; She had, however, scarcely passed us a
hundred yards when it was evident, by the ice pressing her in, as
well as along the shore, that she must soon be stopped like the
<i>Hecla</i>; and having gone about two hundred yards farther she
was observed to receive a severe pressure from a large floe-piece
forcing her directly against a grounded mass of ice upon the
beach.&nbsp; After setting to the southward for an hour or two
longer the ice became stationary, no open water being anywhere
visible from the mast-head, and the pressure on the ships
remaining undiminished during the day.&nbsp; Just as I had
ascertained the utter impossibility of moving the <i>Hecla</i> a
single foot, and that she must lie quite aground fore and aft as
soon as the tide fell, I received a note from Captain Hoppner
informing me that the <i>Fury</i> had been so severely
&ldquo;nipped&rdquo; and strained as to leak a good deal,
apparently about four inches an hour; that she was still heavily
pressed both upon the ground and against the large mass of ice
within her; that the rudder was at present very awkwardly
situated; and that one boat had been much damaged.&nbsp; As the
tide fell the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> stern, which was aground, was
lifted several feet, and the <i>Hecla</i> at low water having
sewed five feet forward and two abaft, we presented altogether no
very pleasing or comfortable spectacle.&nbsp; However, about high
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>water, the ice very opportunely slacking, the
<i>Hecla</i> was hove off with great ease, and warped to a floe
in the offing to which we made fast at midnight.&nbsp; The
<i>Fury</i> was not long after us in coming off the ground, when
I was in hopes of finding that any twist or strain, by which her
leaks might have been occasioned, would, in some measure, have
closed when she was relieved from pressure and once more fairly
afloat.&nbsp; My disappointment and mortification, therefore, may
in some measure be imagined, at being informed by telegraph,
about two A.M. on the 2nd, that the water was gaining on two
pumps, and that a part of the doubling had floated up.&nbsp; The
<i>Hecla</i> having in the mean time been carried two or three
miles to the southward, by the ice which was once more driving in
that direction, I directed Captain Hoppner by signal to endeavour
to reach the best security in-shore which the present slackness
of the ice might permit, until it was possible for the
<i>Hecla</i> to rejoin him.&nbsp; Presently after perceiving from
the mast-head something like a small harbour nearly abreast of
us, every effort was made to get once more towards the
shore.&nbsp; In this the ice happily favoured us, and after
making sail and one or two tacks we got in with the land, when I
left the ship in a boat to sound the place and search for
shelter.&nbsp; I soon had the mortification to find that the
harbour which had appeared to present itself so opportunely, had
not more than six or seven feet water in any part of it, the
whole of its defences being composed of the stones and soil
washed down by a stream which here emptied itself into the
sea.&nbsp; From this place, indeed, where the land gradually
became much lower in advancing to the southward, the whole nature
of the soundings entirely altered, the water gradually shoaling
in approaching the beach, so that the ships <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>could
scarcely come nearer, in most parts, than a quarter of a
mile.&nbsp; At this distance the whole shore was more or less
lined with grounded masses of ice; but after examining the
soundings within more than twenty of them, in the space of about
a mile, I could only find two that would allow the ships to float
at low water, and that by some care in placing and keeping them
there.&nbsp; Having fixed a flag on each berg, the usual signal
for the ships taking their stations, I rowed on board the
<i>Fury</i>, and found four pumps constantly going to keep the
ship free, and Captain Hoppner, his officers and men, almost
exhausted with the incessant labour of the last eight-and-forty
hours.&nbsp; The instant the ships were made fast, Captain
Hoppner and myself set out in a boat to survey the shore still
farther south, there being a narrow lane of water about a mile in
that direction; for it had now become too evident, however
unwilling we might have been at first to admit the conclusion,
that the <i>Fury</i> could proceed no farther without repairs,
and that the nature of those repairs would in all probability
involve the disagreeable, I may say the ruinous, necessity of
heaving the ship down.&nbsp; After rowing about three-quarters of
a mile we considered ourselves fortunate in arriving at a bolder
part of the beach, where three grounded masses of ice, having
from three to four fathoms water at low tide within them, were so
disposed as to afford, with the assistance of art, something like
shelter.&nbsp; Wild and insecure as, under other circumstances,
such a place would have been thought for the purpose of heaving a
ship down, we had no alternative, and therefore as little
occasion as we had time for deliberation.&nbsp; Returning to the
ships, we were setting the sails in order to run to the appointed
place, when the ice closed in and prevented our <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>moving, and
in a short time there was once more no open water to be
seen.&nbsp; We were, therefore, under the necessity of remaining
in our present berths, where the smallest external pressure must
inevitably force us ashore, neither ship having more than two
feet of water to spare.&nbsp; One watch of the
<i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> crew were sent round to assist at the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> pumps, which required one-third of her
ship&rsquo;s company to be constantly employed at them.</p>
<p>The ice coming in with considerable violence on the night of
the 2nd, once more forced the <i>Fury</i> on shore, so that at
low water she sewed two feet and a half.&nbsp; Nothing but the
number and strength of the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> hawsers prevented
her sharing the same fate, for the pressure was just as much as
seven of these of six inches and two stream-cables would
bear.&nbsp; The <i>Fury</i> floated in the morning, and was
enabled to haul off a little, but there was no opening of the ice
to allow us to move to our intended station.&nbsp; The more
leisure we obtained to consider the state of the <i>Fury</i>, the
more apparent became the absolute, however unfortunate, necessity
of heaving her down.&nbsp; Four pumps were required to be at work
without intermission to keep her free, and this in perfectly
smooth water, showing that she was, in fact, so materially
injured as to be very far from seaworthy.&nbsp; One-third of her
working men were constantly employed, as before remarked, in this
laborious operation, and some of their hands had become so sore
from the constant friction of the ropes, that they could hardly
handle them any longer without the use of mittens, assisted by
the unlaying of the ropes to make them soft.&nbsp; When, in
addition to these circumstances, the wet state of the decks and
the little room left, as well as the reduced strength for working
the ship or heaving at hawsers among the ice, be <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>considered, I believe that every seaman will admit the
impracticability of pursuing this critical navigation till the
<i>Fury</i> had been examined and repaired.&nbsp; As, therefore,
not a moment could be lost we took advantage of a small lane of
water deep enough for boats, which kept open within the grounded
masses along the shore, to convey to the <i>Hecla</i> some of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> dry provisions, and to land a quantity of
heavy ironwork and other stores not perishable; for the moment
this measure was determined on I was anxious, almost at any risk,
to commence the lightening of the ship as far as our present
insecurity and our distance from the shore would permit.</p>
<p>The wind blowing fresh from the northward, which always
increased our difficulties on this coast, the ice pressed so
violently upon the ships as almost to force them adrift during
the night, employing our people, now sufficiently harassed by
their work during the day, for two or three hours in still
further increasing our security by additional hawsers.&nbsp; We
continued landing stores from the <i>Fury</i> on the 4th, and at
night a bower cable was passed round one of the grounded masses
alongside of her; for if either ship had once got adrift, it is
difficult to say what might have been the consequence.</p>
<p>At two A.M. on the 5th, the ice began to slacken near the
ships, and as soon as a boat could be rowed along shore to the
southward, I set out, accompanied by a second from the
<i>Fury</i>, for the purpose of examining the state of our
intended harbour since the recent pressure, and to endeavour to
prepare for the reception of the ships by clearing out the loose
ice.&nbsp; On my arrival there, the distance being about a mile,
I found that one of the three bergs had shifted its place so
materially by the late movements of the ice, as not only to alter
the disposition of these masses, <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>on which our
whole dependence rested, very much for the worse, but also to
destroy all confidence in their stability upon the ground.&nbsp;
Landing upon one of the bergs to show the appointed signal for
the ships to come, I perceived, about half a mile beyond us to
the southward, a low point forming a little bay, with a great
deal of heavy grounded ice lying off it.&nbsp; I immediately
rowed to this, in hopes of finding something like a harbour for
our purpose, but on my arrival there, had once more the
mortification to find that there were not above six feet of water
at low tide in any part of it, and within the grounded ice not
more than twelve.&nbsp; Having assured myself that no security or
shelter was here to be found, I immediately returned to the
former place, which the <i>Hecla</i> was just reaching.&nbsp; The
<i>Fury</i> was detained some time by a quantity of loose ice
which had wedged itself in, in such a manner as to leave her no
room to move outwards; but she arrived about seven o&rsquo;clock,
when both ships were made fast in the best berths we could find,
but they were still excluded from their intended place by the
quantity of ice which had fixed itself there.&nbsp; Within twenty
minutes after our arrival, the whole body of ice again came in,
entirely closing up the shore, so that our moving proved most
opportune.</p>

<p>As there was now no longer room for floating the ice out of
our proposed basin, all hands were immediately employed in
preparing the intended securities against the incursions of the
ice.&nbsp; These consisted of anchors carried to the beach,
having bower-cables attached to them, passing quite round the
grounded masses, and thus enclosing a small space of just
sufficient size to admit both ships.&nbsp; The cables we proposed
floating by means of the two hand-masts and some empty casks
lashed to them as buoys, with the intention of thus making them
receive the pressure of the ice a foot or two below the surface
of the water.&nbsp; By uncommon exertions on the part of the
officers and men, this laborious work was completed before night
as far as was practicable until the loose ice should set out; and
all the tents were set up on the beach for the reception of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> stores.</p>
<p>The ice remaining quite close on the 6th, every individual in
both ships, with the exception of those at the pumps, was
employed in landing provisions from the <i>Fury</i>, together
with the spars, boats, and everything from off her upper
deck.&nbsp; The ice coming in, in the afternoon, with a degree of
pressure which usually attended a northerly wind on this coast,
twisted the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> rudder so forcibly against a mass
of ice lying under her <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>stern that it was for some hours in
great danger of being damaged, and was indeed only saved by the
efforts of Captain Hoppner and his officers, who, without
breaking off the men from their other occupations, themselves
worked at the ice-saw.&nbsp; On the following day, the ice
remaining as before, the work was continued without intermission,
and a great quantity of things landed.&nbsp; The two carpenters
(Messrs. Pulfer and Fiddis) took the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> boats in
hand themselves, their men being required as part of our physical
strength in clearing the ship.&nbsp; The armourer was also set to
work on the beach in forging bolts for the martingales of the
outriggers.&nbsp; In short, every living creature among us was
somehow or other employed, not even excepting our dogs, which
were set to drag up the stores on the beach; so that our little
dockyard soon exhibited the most animated scene imaginable.&nbsp;
The quickest method of landing casks and other things not too
weighty, was that adopted by Captain Hoppner, and consisted of a
hawser secured to the ship&rsquo;s main mast-head, and set up as
tight as possible to the anchor on the beach; the casks being
hooked to a block traversing on this as a jack-stay, were made to
run down it with great velocity.&nbsp; By this means more than
two were got on shore for every one landed by the boats, the
latter, however, being constantly employed in addition.&nbsp; The
<i>Fury</i> was thus so much lightened in the course of the day
that two pumps were now nearly sufficient to keep her free, and
this number continued requisite until she was hove down.&nbsp;
Her spirit-room was now entirely clear, and, on examination, the
water was found to be rushing in through two or three holes that
happened to be in the ceiling, and which were immediately plugged
up.&nbsp; Indeed; it was now very evident that nothing but <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>the tightness of the Fury&rsquo;s diagonal ceiling had
so long kept her afloat, and that any ship not thus fortified
within could not possibly have been kept free by the pumps.</p>
<p>At night, just as the people were going to rest, the ice began
to move to the southward, and soon after came in towards the
shore, again endangering the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> rudder, and
pressing her over on her side to so alarming a degree, as to warn
us that it would not be safe to lighten her much more in her
present insecure situation.&nbsp; One of our bergs also shifted
its position by this pressure, so as to weaken our confidence in
the pier-heads of our intended basin; and a long
&ldquo;tongue&rdquo; of one of them forcing itself under the
<i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> forefoot, while the drift-ice was also
pressing her forcibly from astern, she once more sewed three or
four feet forward at low water, and continued to do so,
notwithstanding repeated endeavours to haul her off, for four
successive tides the ice remaining so close and so much doubled
under the ship, as to render it impossible to move her a single
inch.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the state of the ice, however, we did
not remain idle on the 8th, all hands being employed in unrigging
the <i>Fury</i>, and landing all her spars, sails, booms, boats,
and other top-weight.</p>
<p>The ice still continuing very close on the 9th, all hands were
employed in attempting, by saws and axes, to clear the
<i>Hecla</i>, which still grounded on the tongue of ice every
tide.&nbsp; After four hours&rsquo; labour, they succeeded in
making four or five feet of room astern, when the ship suddenly
slid down off the tongue with considerable force, and became once
more afloat.&nbsp; We then got on shore the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i>
cables and hawsers for the accommodation of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> men in our tiers during the heaving <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>down,
struck our top-masts which would be required as shores and
outriggers, and, in short, continued to occupy every individual
in some preparation or other.&nbsp; These being entirely
completed at an early hour in the afternoon, we ventured to go on
with the landing of the coals and provisions from the
<i>Fury</i>, preferring to run the risk which would thus be
incurred, to the loss of even a few hours in the accomplishment
of our present object.&nbsp; As it very opportunely happened,
however, the external ice slackened to the distance of about a
hundred yards outside of us on the morning of the 10th, enabling
us, by a most tedious and laborious operation, to clear the ice
out of our basin piece by piece.&nbsp; The difficulty of this
apparently simple process consisted in the heavy pressure having
repeatedly doubled one mass under another&mdash;a position in
which it requires great power to move them&mdash;and also by the
corners locking in with the sides of the bergs.&nbsp; Our next
business was to tighten the cables sufficiently by means of
purchases, and to finish the floating of them in the manner and
for the purpose before described.&nbsp; After this had been
completed, the ships had only a few feet in length, and nothing
in breadth to spare; but we had now great hopes of going on with
our work with increased confidence and security.&nbsp; The
<i>Fury</i>, which was placed inside, had something less than
eighteen feet at low water; the <i>Hecla</i> lay in four fathoms,
the bottom being strewed with large and small fragments of
limestone.</p>
<p>While thus employed in securing the ships, the smoothness of
the water enabled us to see in some degree the nature of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> damage; and it may be conceived how much pain
it occasioned us plainly to discover that both the stern-post and
forefoot were broken and turned <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>up on one
side with the pressure.&nbsp; We also could perceive as far as we
were able to see along the main-keel, that it was much torn, and
we had therefore reason to conclude that the damage would
altogether prove very serious.&nbsp; We also discovered that
several feet of the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> false keel were torn
away abreast of the fore-chains, in consequence of her grounding
forward so frequently.</p>
<p>The ships being now as well secured as our means permitted
from the immediate danger of ice, the clearing of the <i>Fury</i>
went on during the 11th with increased confidence, though greater
alacrity was impossible, for nothing could exceed the spirit and
zealous activity of every individual, and as things had turned
out, the ice had not obliged us to wait a moment, except at the
actual times of its pressure.&nbsp; Being favoured with fine
weather, we continued our work very quickly, so that on the 12th
every cask was landed and also the powder; and the spare sails
and clothing put on board the <i>Hecla</i>.&nbsp; On the 13th we
found that a mass of heavy ice, which had been aground within the
<i>Fury</i>, had now floated off alongside of her at high water,
still further contracting our already narrow basin, and leaving
the ship no room for turning round.&nbsp; At the next high water,
therefore, we got a purchase on it and hove it out of the way, so
that at night it drifted off altogether.&nbsp; The coals and
preserved meats were the principal things now remaining on board
the <i>Fury</i>, and these we continued landing by every method
we could devise as the most expeditious.&nbsp; The tide rose so
considerably at night, new moon occurring within an hour of high
water, that we were much afraid of our bergs floating: they
remained firm, however, even though the ice came in with so much
force as to break one of our hand-masts, <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>a fir spar of
twelve inches diameter.&nbsp; As the high tides and the
lightening of the <i>Fury</i> now gave us sufficient depth of
water for unshipping the rudders, we did so, and laid them upon
the small berg astern of us, for fear of their being damaged by
any pressure of the ice.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 14th, the ice slackening a little
in our neighbourhood, we took advantage of it, though the people
were much fagged, to tighten the cables, which had stretched and
yielded considerably by the late pressure.&nbsp; It was well that
we did so; for in the course of this day we were several times
interrupted in our work by the ice coming with a tremendous
strain on the north cables, the wind blowing strong from the
N.N.W., and the whole &ldquo;pack&rdquo; outside of us setting
rapidly to the southward.&nbsp; Indeed, notwithstanding the
recent tightening and readjustment of the cables, the bight was
pressed in so much as to force the <i>Fury</i> against the berg
astern of her twice in the course of the day.&nbsp; Mr. Waller,
who was in the hold the second time that this occurred, reported
that the coals about the keelson were moved by it, imparting the
sensation of a part of the ship&rsquo;s bottom falling down; and
one of the men at work there was so strongly impressed with that
belief that he thought it high time to make a spring for the
hatchway.&nbsp; From this circumstance it seemed more than
probable that the main keel had received some serious damage near
the middle of the ship.</p>
<p>From this trial of the efficacy of our means of security, it
was plain that the <i>Fury</i> could not possibly be hove down
under circumstances of such frequent and imminent risk; I
therefore directed a fourth anchor, with two additional cables,
to be carried out, with the hope <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of breaking
some of the force of the ice by its offering a more oblique
resistance than the other, and thus by degrees turning the
direction of the pressure from the ships.&nbsp; We had scarcely
completed this new defence, when the largest floe we had seen
since leaving Port Bowen came sweeping along the shore, having a
motion to the southward of not less than a mile and a half an
hour; and a projecting point of it just grazing our outer berg,
threatened to overturn it, and would certainly have dislodged it
from its situation but for the cable recently attached to
it.&nbsp; A second similar occurrence took place with a smaller
mass of ice about midnight, and near the top of an unusually high
spring tide, which seemed ready to float away every security from
us.&nbsp; For three hours about the time of this high water, our
situation was a most critical one, for had the bergs, or indeed
any one of them, been carried away or broken, both ships must
inevitably have been driven on shore by the very next mass of ice
that should come in.&nbsp; Happily, however, they did not suffer
any further material disturbance, and the main body keeping at a
short distance from the land until the tide had fallen, the bergs
seemed to be once more firmly resting on the ground.&nbsp; The
only mischief, therefore, occasioned by this disturbance was the
slackening of our cables by the alteration in the positions of
the several grounded masses, and the consequent necessity of
employing more time, which nothing but absolute necessity could
induce us to bestow in adjusting and tightening the whole of them
afresh.</p>
<p>The wind veering to the W.N.W. on the morning of the 15th, and
still continuing to blow strong, the ice was forced three or four
miles off the land in the course of <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>a few hours,
leaving us a quiet day for continuing our work, but exciting no
very pleasing sensations when we considered what progress we
might have been making had we been at liberty to pursue our
object.&nbsp; The land was, indeed, so clear of ice to the
southward that Dr. Neill, who walked a considerable distance in
that direction, could see nothing but an open channel in-shore to
the utmost extent of his view.&nbsp; We took advantage of this
open water to send the launch for the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i>
ironwork left at the former station; for though the few men thus
employed could very ill be spared, we were obliged to arrange
everything with reference to the ultimate saving of time; and it
would have occupied both ships&rsquo; companies more than a whole
day to carry the things round by land.</p>
<p>The <i>Fury</i> being completely cleared at an early hour on
the 16th, we were all busily employed in &ldquo;winding&rdquo;
the ship, and in preparing the outriggers, shores, purchases, and
additional rigging.&nbsp; Though we purposely selected the time
of high water for turning the ship round, we had scarcely a foot
of space to spare for doing it, and indeed, as it was, her
forefoot touched the ground, and loosened the broken part of the
wood so much as to enable us to pull it up with ropes, when we
found the fragments to consist of the whole of the
&ldquo;gripe&rdquo; and most of the &ldquo;cutwater.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The strong breeze continuing, and the sea rising as the open
water increased in extent, our bergs were sadly washed and
wasted; every hour producing a sensible and serious diminution in
their bulk.&nbsp; As, however, the main body of ice still kept
off, we were in hopes, now that our preparations were so near
completed, we should have been enabled in a few hours to see the
extent of the damage, and repair it sufficiently to <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>allow
us to proceed.&nbsp; In the evening we received the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> crew on board the <i>Hecla</i>, every
arrangement and regulation having been previously made for their
personal comfort, and for the preservation of cleanliness,
ventilation, and dry warmth throughout the ship.&nbsp; The
officers of the <i>Fury</i>, by their own choice, pitched a tent
on shore for messing and sleeping in, as our accommodation for
two sets of officers was necessarily confined.&nbsp; On the 17th,
when every preparation was completed, the cables were found again
so slack, by the wasting of the bergs in consequence of the
continued sea, and possibly also in part by the masses having
moved somewhat in-shore, that we were obliged to occupy several
hours in putting them to rights, as we should soon require all
our strength at the purchases.&nbsp; One berg had also, at the
last low water, fallen over on its side in consequence of its
substance being undermined by the sea, and the cable surrounding
it was thus forced so low under water as no longer to afford
protection from the ice should it again come in.&nbsp; In
tightening the cables, we found it to have the effect of bringing
the bergs in towards the shore, still further contracting our
narrow basin; but anything was better than suffering them to go
adrift.&nbsp; This work being finished at ten P.M. the people
were allowed three hours&rsquo; rest only, it being necessary to
heave the ship down at or near high water, as there was not
sufficient depth to allow her to take her distance at any other
time of tide.&nbsp; Every preparation being made, at three A.M.
on the 18th, we began to heave her down on the larboard side, but
when the purchases were nearly a-block, we found that the strops
under the <i>Hecla&rsquo;a</i> bottom, as well as some of the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> shorefasts, had stretched or yielded so much,
that they could not bring <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the keel out
of water within three or four feet.&nbsp; We immediately eased
her up again, and readjusted everything as requisite, hauling her
farther in-shore than before by keeping a considerable heel upon
her, so as to make less depth of water necessary; and we were
then in the act of once more heaving her down, when a snowstorm
came on and blew with such violence off the land, as to raise a
considerable sea.&nbsp; The ships had now so much motion as to
strain the gear very much, and even to make the lower masts of
the <i>Fury</i> bend in spite of the shores: we were, therefore,
most unwillingly compelled to desist until the sea should go
down, keeping everything ready to recommence the instant we could
possibly do so with safety.&nbsp; The officers and men were now
literally so harassed and fatigued as to be scarcely capable of
further exertion without some rest; and on this and one or two
other occasions, I noticed more than a single instance of stupor
amounting to a certain degree of failure in intellect, rendering
the individual so affected quite unable at first to comprehend
the meaning of an order, though still as willing as ever to obey
it.&nbsp; It was therefore perhaps a fortunate necessity which
produced the intermission of labour which the strength of every
individual seemed to require.</p>
<p>The gale rather increasing than otherwise during the whole day
and night of the 18th, had on the following morning, when the
wind and sea still continued unabated, so destroyed the bergs on
which our sole dependence was placed, that they no longer
remained aground at low water; the cables had again become slack
about them, and the basin we had taken so much pains in forming
had now lost all its defences, at least during a portion of every
tide.&nbsp; It will be plain, too, if I have succeeded in <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>giving a distinct description of our situation, that,
independently of the security of the ships, there was now nothing
left to seaward by which the <i>Hecla</i> could be held out in
that direction while heaving the <i>Fury</i> down, so that our
preparations in this way were no longer available.&nbsp; After a
night of most anxious consideration and consultation with Captain
Hoppner, who was now my messmate in the <i>Hecla</i>, it appeared
but too plain, that, should the ice again come in, neither ship
could any longer be secured from driving on shore.&nbsp; It was
therefore determined instantly to prepare the <i>Hecla</i> for
sea, making her thoroughly effective in every respect; so that we
might at least push her out into comparative safety among the
ice, when it closed again, taking every person on board her,
securing the <i>Fury</i> in the best manner we could, and
returning to her the instant we were able to do so, to endeavour
to get her out, and to carry her to some place of security for
heaving down.&nbsp; If, after the <i>Hecla</i> was ready, time
should still be allowed us, it was proposed immediately to put
into the <i>Fury</i> all that was requisite, or at least as much
as she could safely carry, and towing her out into the ice, to
try the effect of &ldquo;foddering&rdquo; the leaks by sails
under those parts of her keel which we knew to be damaged, until
some more effectual means could be resorted to.</p>
<p>Having communicated to the assembled officers and ships&rsquo;
companies my views and intentions, and moreover given them to
understand that I hoped to see the <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i>
top-gallant-yards across before we slept, we commenced our work;
and such was the hearty goodwill and indefatigable energy with
which it was carried on, that by midnight the whole was
accomplished, and a bower-anchor and cable carried out in the
offing, for the double <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>purpose of hauling out the
<i>Hecla</i> when requisite, and as some security to the
<i>Fury</i>, if we were obliged to leave her.&nbsp; The people
were once more quite exhausted by these exertions, especially
those belonging to the <i>Fury</i>, who had never thoroughly
recovered their first fatigues.&nbsp; The ice being barely in
sight, we were enabled to enjoy seven hours of undisturbed rest;
but the wind becoming light, and afterwards shifting to the
N.N.E., we had reason to expect the ice would soon close the
shore, and were, therefore, most anxious to continue our
work.</p>
<p>On the 20th, therefore, the reloading of the <i>Fury</i>
commenced with recruited strength and spirits, such articles
being in the first place selected for putting on board as were
essentially requisite for her re-equipment; for it was my full
determination, could we succeed in completing this, not to wait
even for rigging a topmast, or getting a lower yard up, in the
event of the ice coming in, but to tow her out among the ice, and
there put everything sufficiently to rights for carrying her to
some place of security.&nbsp; At the same time, the end of the
sea-cable was taken on board the <i>Fury</i>, by way of offering
some resistance to the ice, which was now more plainly seen,
though still about five miles distant, A few hands were also
spared, consisting chiefly of two or three convalescents, and
some of the officers, to thrum a sail for putting under the
<i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> keel; for we were very anxious to relieve the
men at the pumps, which constantly required the labour of eight
to twelve hands to keep her free.&nbsp; In the course of the day,
several heavy masses of ice came drifting by with a breeze from
the N.E., which is here about two points upon the land, and made
a considerable swell.&nbsp; One mass came in contact with our
bergs, which, though only held by the cables, brought it up in
time to <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>prevent mischief.&nbsp; By a long and
hard day&rsquo;s labour, the people not going to rest till two
o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 21st, we got about fifty
tons&rsquo; weight of coals and provisions on board the
<i>Fury</i>, which, in case of necessity, we considered
sufficient to give her stability.&nbsp; While we were thus
employed, the ice, though evidently inclined to come in, did not
approach us much; and it may be conceived with what anxiety we
longed to be allowed one more day&rsquo;s labour, on which the
ultimate saving of the ship might almost be considered as
depending.&nbsp; Having hauled the ships out a little from the
shore and prepared the <i>Hecla</i> for casting by a spring at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, all the people except those at the pumps
were sent to rest, which, however, they had not enjoyed for two
hours, when at four A.M. on the 21st, another heavy mass coming
violently in contact with the bergs and cables, threatened to
sweep away every remaining security.&nbsp; Our situation, with
this additional strain, the mass which had disturbed us fixing
itself upon the weather-cable, and an increasing wind and swell
setting considerably on the shore, became more and more
precarious; and indeed, under circumstances as critical as can
well be imagined, nothing but the urgency and importance of the
object we had in view&mdash;that of saving the <i>Fury</i> if she
was to be saved&mdash;could have prevented my making sail, and
keeping the <i>Hecla</i> under way till matters mended.&nbsp;
More hawsers were run out, however, and enabled us still to hold
on; and after six hours of disturbed rest, all hands were again
set to work to get the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> anchors, cables,
rudder, and spars on board, these things being absolutely
necessary for her equipment, should we be able to get her
out.&nbsp; At two P.M. the crews were called on board to dinner,
which they had not finished when several not very large masses
<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>of ice drove along the shore near us at a quick rate,
and two or three successively coming in violent contact either
with the <i>Hecla</i> or the bergs to which she was attached,
convinced me that very little additional pressure would tear
everything away, and drive both ships on shore.&nbsp; I saw that
the moment had arrived when the <i>Hecla</i> could no longer be
kept in her present situation with the smallest chance of safety,
and therefore immediately got under sail, dispatching Captain
Hoppner with every individual, except a few for working the ship,
to continue getting the things on board the <i>Fury</i>, while
the <i>Hecla</i> stood off and on.&nbsp; It was a quarter-past
three P.M. when we cast off, the wind then blowing fresh from the
north-east, or about two points upon the land, which caused some
surf on the beach.&nbsp; Captain Hoppner had scarcely been an
hour on board the <i>Fury</i>, and was busily engaged in getting
the anchors and cables on board, when we observed some large
pieces of not very heavy ice closing in with the land near her;
and at twenty minutes past four P.M., being an hour and five
minutes after the <i>Hecla</i> had cast off, I was informed by
signal that the <i>Fury</i> was on shore.&nbsp; Making a tack
in-shore, but not being able, even under a press of canvas, to
get very near her, owing to a strong southerly current which
prevailed within a mile or two of the land, I perceived that she
had been apparently driven up the beach by two or three of the
grounded masses forcing her onwards before them, and these, as
well as the ship, seemed now so firmly aground as entirely to
block her in on the seaward side.&nbsp; As the navigating of the
<i>Hecla</i> with only ten men on board required constant
attention and care, I could not at this time with propriety leave
the ship to go on board the <i>Fury</i>.&nbsp; This, however, I
the less regretted as Captain <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Hoppner was
thoroughly acquainted with all my views and intentions, and I
felt confident that, under his direction, nothing would be left
undone to endeavour to save the ship.&nbsp; I, therefore,
directed him by telegraph, &ldquo;if he thought nothing could be
done at present, to return on board with all hands until the wind
changed;&rdquo; for this alone, as far as I could see the state
of the <i>Fury</i>, seemed to offer the smallest chance of
clearing the shore, so as to enable us to proceed with our work,
or to attempt hauling the ship off the ground.&nbsp; About seven
P.M. Captain Hoppner returned to the <i>Hecla</i>, accompanied by
all hands, except an officer with a party at the pumps, reporting
to me that the <i>Fury</i> had been forced aground by the ice
pressing on the masses lying near her, and bringing home, if not
breaking, the seaward anchor, so that the ship was soon found to
have sewed from two to three feet fore and aft.</p>
<p>With the ship thus situated, and masses of heavy ice
constantly coming in, it was Captain Hoppner&rsquo;s decided
opinion, as well as that of Lieutenants Austin and Ross, that to
have laid out another anchor to seaward would have only been to
expose it to the same damage as there was reason to suppose had
been incurred with the other, without the most distant hope of
doing any service; especially as the ship had been driven on
shore, by a most unfortunate coincidence, just as the tide was
beginning to fall.&nbsp; Indeed, in the present state of the
<i>Fury</i>, nothing short of chopping and sawing up a part of
the ice under her stern could by any possibility have effected
her release, even if she had been already afloat.&nbsp; Under
such circumstances, hopeless as for the time every seaman will
admit them to have been, Captain Hoppner judiciously determined
to return for the present, as directed by my <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>telegraphic
communication; but being anxious to keep the ship free from water
as long as possible, he left an officer and a small party of men
to continue working at the pumps so long as a communication could
be kept up between the <i>Hecla</i> and the shore.&nbsp; Every
moment, however, decreased the practicability of doing this; and
finding, soon after Captain Hoppner&rsquo;s return, that the
current swept the <i>Hecla</i> a long way to the southward while
hoisting up the boats, and that more ice was drifting in towards
the shore, I was under the painful necessity of recalling the
party at the pumps, rather than incur the risk, now an inevitable
one, of parting company with them altogether.&nbsp; Accordingly
Mr. Bird, with the last of the people, came on board at eight
o&rsquo;clock in the evening, having left eighteen inches of
water in the well, and four pumps being requisite to keep her
free.&nbsp; In three hours after Mr. Bird&rsquo;s return, more
than half a mile of closely-packed ice intervened between the
<i>Fury</i> and the open water in which we were beating, and
before the morning this barrier had increased to four or five
miles in breadth.</p>
<p>We carried a press of canvas all night, with a fresh breeze
from the north, to enable us to keep abreast of the <i>Fury</i>,
which, on account of the strong southerly current, we could only
do by beating at some distance from the land.&nbsp; The breadth
of the ice in-shore continued increasing during the day, but we
could see no end to the water in which we were beating, either to
the southward or eastward.&nbsp; Advantage was taken of the
little leisure now allowed us, to let the people mend and wash
their clothes, which they had scarcely had a moment to do for the
last three weeks.&nbsp; We also completed the thrumming of a
second sail for putting under the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> keel
whenever we should be enabled to haul her off the shore.&nbsp; It
fell <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>quite calm in the evening, when the breadth of the ice
in-shore had increased to six or seven miles.&nbsp; We did not
during the day perceive any current setting to the southward, but
in the course of the night we were drifted four or five leagues
to the south-westward, in which situation we had a distinct view
of a large extent of land, which had before been seen for the
first time by some of our gentlemen who walked from where the
<i>Fury</i> lay.&nbsp; This land trends very much to the
westward, a little beyond the Fury Point, the name by which I
have distinguished that headland near which we had attempted to
heave the <i>Fury</i> down, and which is very near the southern
part of this coast, seen in the year 1819.&nbsp; It then sweeps
round into a large bay, formed by a long, low beach several miles
in extent, afterwards joining higher land, and running in a
south-easterly direction to a point which terminated our view of
it in that quarter, and which bore from us S. 58&deg; W. distant
six or seven leagues.&nbsp; This headland I named Cape Garry,
after my worthy friend Nicholas Garry, Esq., one of the most
active members of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, and a gentleman
most warmly interested in everything connected with northern
discovery.&nbsp; The whole of the bay (which I named after my
much esteemed friend, Francis Cresswell, Esq.), as well as the
land to the southward, was free from ice for several miles, and
to the southward and eastward scarcely any was to be seen, while
a dark water-sky indicated a perfectly navigable sea in that
direction; but between us and the Fury there was a compact body
of ice eight or nine miles in breadth.&nbsp; Had we now been at
liberty to take advantage of the favourable prospect before us, I
have little doubt we should without much difficulty have made
considerable progress.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>A southerly breeze enabling us to regain our northing,
we ran along the margin of the ice, but were led so much to the
eastward by it, that we could approach the ship no nearer than
before during the whole day.&nbsp; She appeared to us at this
distance to have a much greater heel than when the people left
her, which made us still more anxious to get near her.&nbsp; A
south-west wind gave us hopes of the ice setting off from the
land, but it produced no good effect during the whole of the
24th.&nbsp; We, therefore, beat again to the southward to see if
we could manage to get in with the land anywhere about the shores
of the bay; but this was now impracticable, the ice being once
more closely packed there.&nbsp; We could only wait, therefore,
in patience, for some alteration in our favour.&nbsp; The
latitude at noon was 72&deg; 34&prime; 57&Prime;, making our
distance from the <i>Fury</i> twelve miles, which by the morning
of the 25th had increased to at least five leagues, the ice
continuing to &ldquo;pack&rdquo; between us and the shore.&nbsp;
The wind, however, now gradually drew round to the westward,
giving us hopes of a change, and we continued to ply about the
margin of the ice, in constant readiness for taking advantage of
any opening that might occur.&nbsp; It favoured us so much by
streaming off in the course of the day, that by seven P.M. we had
nearly reached a channel of clear water, which kept open for
seven or eight miles from the land.&nbsp; Being impatient to
obtain a sight of the <i>Fury</i>, and the wind becoming light,
Captain Hoppner and myself left the <i>Hecla</i> in two boats,
and reached the ship at half-past nine, or about three-quarters
of an hour before high water, being the most favourable time of
tide for arriving to examine her condition.</p>
<p>We found her heeling so much outward, that her main channels
were within a foot of the water; and the large <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>floe-piece,
which was still alongside of her, seemed alone to support her
below water, and to prevent her falling over still more
considerably.&nbsp; The ship had been forced much further up the
beach than before, and she had now in her bilge above nine feet
of water, which reached higher than the lower-deck beams.&nbsp;
On looking down the stern-post, which, seen against the
light-coloured ground, and in shoal water, was now very
distinctly visible, we found that she had pushed the stones at
the bottom up before her, and that the broken keel, stern-post,
and deadwood had, by the recent pressure, been more damaged and
turned up than before.&nbsp; She appeared principally to hang
upon the ground abreast of the gangway, where, at high water, the
depth was eleven feet alongside her keel; forward and aft from
thirteen to sixteen feet; so that at low tide, allowing the usual
fall of five or six feet, she would be lying in a depth of from
five to ten feet only.&nbsp; The first hour&rsquo;s inspection of
the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> condition too plainly assured me that
exposed as she was, and forcibly pressed up upon an open and
stony beach, her holds full of water, and the damage of her hull
to all appearance and in all probability more considerable than
before, without any adequate means of hauling her off to seaward,
or securing her from the further incursions of the ice, every
endeavour of ours to get her off, or if got off, to float her to
any known place of safety, would be at once utterly hopeless in
itself, and productive of extreme risk to our remaining ship.</p>
<p>Being anxious, however, in a case of so much importance, to
avail myself of the judgment and experience of others, I directed
Captain Hoppner, in conjunction with Lieutenants Austin and
Sherer, and Mr. Pulfer, carpenter, being the officers who
accompanied me to the <i>Fury</i>, to <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>hold a survey
upon her, and to report their opinions to me.&nbsp; And to
prevent the possibility of the officers receiving any bias from
my own opinion, the order was given to them the moment we arrived
on board the <i>Fury</i>.</p>
<p>Captain Hoppner and the other officers, after spending several
hours in attentively examining every part of the ship, both
within and without, and maturely weighing all the circumstances
of her situation, gave it as their opinion that it would be quite
impracticable to make her seaworthy, even if she could be hauled
off, which would first require the water to be got out of the
ship, and the holds to be once more entirely cleared.&nbsp; Mr.
Pulfer, the carpenter of the <i>Fury</i>, considered that it
would occupy five days to clear the ship of water; that if she
were got off, all the pumps would not be sufficient to keep her
free, in consequence of the additional damage she seemed to have
sustained; and that, if even hove down, twenty days&rsquo; work,
with the means we possessed, would be required for making her
seaworthy.&nbsp; Captain Hoppner and the other officers were,
therefore, of opinion that an absolute necessity existed for
abandoning the <i>Fury</i>.&nbsp; My own opinion being thus
confirmed as to the utter hopelessness of saving her, and feeling
more strongly than ever the responsibility which attached to me
of preserving the <i>Hecla</i> unhurt, it was with extreme pain
and regret that I made the signal for the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i>
officers and men to be sent for their clothes, most of which had
been put on shore with the stores.</p>
<p>The <i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> bower-anchor, which had been placed
on the beach, was sent on board as soon as the people came on
shore; but her remaining cable was too much entangled with the
grounded ice to be disengaged without great loss of time.&nbsp;
Having allowed the officers and men <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>an hour for
packing up their clothes, and what else belonging to them the
water in the ship had not covered, the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> boats
were hauled up on the beach, and at two A.M. I left her, and was
followed by Captain Hoppner, Lieutenant Austin, and the last of
the people in half an hour after.</p>
<p>The whole of the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> stores were of necessity
left either on board her or on shore, every spare corner that we
could find in the <i>Hecla</i> being now absolutely required for
the accommodation of our double complement of officers and men,
whose cleanliness and health could only be maintained by keeping
the decks as clear and well ventilated as our limited space would
permit.&nbsp; The spot where the <i>Fury</i> was left is in
latitude 72&deg; 42&prime; 30&Prime;, the longitude by
chronometers is 91&deg; 50&prime; 05&Prime;, the dip of the
magnetic needle 88&deg; 19&prime; 22&Prime;, and the variation
129&deg; 25&prime; westerly.</p>
<p>When the accident first happened to the <i>Fury</i>, I
confidently expected to have been able to repair her damages in
good time to take advantage of a large remaining part of the
navigable season in the prosecution of the voyage; and while the
clearing of the ship was going on with so much alacrity, and the
repairs seemed to be within the reach of our means and resources,
I still flattered myself with the same hope.&nbsp; But as soon as
the gales began to destroy, with a rapidity of which we had
before no conception, our sole defence from the incursions of the
ice, as well as the only trustworthy means we before possessed of
holding the <i>Hecla</i> out for heaving the <i>Fury</i> down, I
confess that the prospect of the necessity then likely to arise
for removing her to some other station, was sufficient to shake
every reasonable expectation I had hitherto cherished of the
ultimate accomplishment of our object.&nbsp; Those <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>expectations were now at an end.&nbsp; With a
twelvemonth&rsquo;s provisions for both ships&rsquo; companies,
extending our resources only to the autumn of the following year,
it would have been folly to hope for final success, considering
the small progress we had already made, the uncertain nature of
this navigation, and the advanced period of the present
season.&nbsp; I was, therefore, reduced to the only remaining
conclusion that it was my duty, under all the circumstances of
the case, to return to England, in compliance with the plain
tenor of my instructions.&nbsp; As soon as the boats were hoisted
up, therefore, and the anchor stowed, the ship&rsquo;s head was
put to the north-eastward, with a light air off the land, in
order to gain an offing before the ice should again set
in-shore.</p>

<p>The accident which had now befallen the <i>Fury</i>, and
which, when its fatal result was finally ascertained, at once put
an end to every prospect of success in the main object of this
voyage, is not an event which will excite surprise in the minds
of those who are either personally acquainted with the true
nature of this precarious navigation, or have had patience to
follow me through the tedious and monotonous detail of our
operations during seven successive summers.&nbsp; To any persons
thus qualified to judge it will be plain that an occurrence of
this nature was at all times rather to be expected than
otherwise, <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and that the only real cause for
wonder has been our long exemption from such a catastrophe.&nbsp;
I can confidently affirm, and I trust that on such an occasion I
may be permitted to make the remark, that the mere safety of the
ships has never been more than a secondary object in the conduct
of the expeditions under my command.&nbsp; To push forward while
there was any open water to enable us to do so has uniformly been
our first endeavour; it has not been until the channel has
actually terminated that we have ever been accustomed to look for
a place of shelter, to which the ships were then conducted with
all possible despatch; and I may safely venture to predict that
no ship acting otherwise will ever accomplish the Northwest
Passage.&nbsp; On numerous occasions, which will easily recur to
the memory of those I have had the honour to command, the ships
might easily have been placed among the ice and left to drift
with it in comparative, if not absolute, security, when the
holding them on has been preferred, though attended with hourly
and imminent peril.&nbsp; This was precisely the case on the
present occasion; the ships might certainly have been pushed into
the ice a day or two, or even a week beforehand, and thus
preserved from all risk of being forced on shore; but where they
would have been drifted, and when they would have been again
disengaged from the ice, or at liberty to take advantage of the
occasional openings in-shore (by which alone the navigation of
these seas is to be performed with any degree of certainty), I
believe it impossible for any one to form the most distant
idea.&nbsp; Such, then, being the necessity for constant and
unavoidable risk, it cannot reasonably excite surprise that on a
single occasion out of so many in which the same accident seemed,
as it were, impending, it should actually have taken place.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>The ice we met with after leaving Port Bowen, previously
to the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> disaster, and for some days after, I
consider to have been much the lightest as well as the most
broken we have ever had to contend with.&nbsp; During the time we
were shut up at our last station near the <i>Fury</i>, one or two
floes of very large dimensions drifted past us; and these were of
that heavy &ldquo;hummocky&rdquo; kind which we saw off Cape
Kater in the beginning of August, 1819.&nbsp; On the whole,
however, Mr. Allison and myself had constant occasion to remark
the total absence of floes, and the unusual lightness of the
other ice.&nbsp; We thought, indeed, that this latter
circumstance might account for its being almost incessantly in
motion on this coast; for heavy ice, when once it is pressed home
upon the shore, and has ceased to move, generally remains quiet,
until a change of wind or tide makes it slacken.&nbsp; But with
lighter ice, the frequent breaking and doubling of the parts
which sustain the strain, whenever any increase of pressure takes
place, will set the whole body once more in motion till the space
is again filled up.&nbsp; This was so often the case while our
ships lay in the most exposed situations on this unsheltered
coast, that we were never relieved for a moment from the
apprehension of some new and increased pressure.</p>
<p>The summer of 1825 was, beyond all doubt, the warmest and most
favourable we had experienced since that of 1818.&nbsp; Not more
than two or three days occurred, during the months of July and
August, in which that heavy fall of snow took place which so
commonly converts the aspect of Nature in these regions, in a
single hour, from the cheerfulness of summer into the dreariness
of winter.&nbsp; Indeed, we experienced very little either of
snow, rain, or fog; vegetation, wherever the soil allowed any to
spring <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>up, was extremely luxuriant and
forward; a great deal of the old snow which had laid on the
ground during the last season was rapidly dissolving even early
in August; and every appearance of Nature exhibited a striking
contrast with the last summer, while it seemed evidently to
furnish an extraordinary compensation for its rigour and
inclemency.</p>
<p>We have scarcely ever visited a coast on which so little of
animal life occurs.&nbsp; For days together, only one or two
seals, a single sea-horse, and now and then a flock of ducks,
were seen.&nbsp; I have already mentioned, however, as an
exception to this scarcity of animals, the numberless kittiwakes
which were flying about the remarkable spout of water; and we
were one day visited, at the place where the <i>Fury</i> was
left, by hundreds of white whales sporting about in the shoal
water close to the beach.&nbsp; No black whales were ever seen on
this coast.&nbsp; Two reindeer were observed by the gentlemen who
extended their walks inland; but this was the only summer in
which we did not procure a single pound of venison.&nbsp; Indeed,
the whole of our supplies obtained in this way during the voyage,
including fish, flesh, and fowl, did not exceed twenty pounds per
man.</p>
<p>During the time that we were made fast upon this coast, in
which situation alone observations on current can be
satisfactorily made, it is certain that the ice was setting to
the southward, and sometimes at a rapid rate, full seven days out
of every ten on an average.&nbsp; Had I now witnessed this for
the first time in these seas, I should probably have concluded
that there was a constant southerly set at this season; but the
experience we had before obtained of that superficial current
which every breeze of wind creates in a sea encumbered with ice,
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>coupled with the fact that while this set was noticed we
had an almost continual prevalence of northerly winds, inclines
me to believe that it was to be attributed&mdash;chiefly at
least&mdash;to this circumstance, especially as, on one or two
occasions, with rather a light breeze from the southward, the ice
did set slowly in the opposite direction.&nbsp; It is not by a
few unconnected observations that a question of this kind is to
be settled, as the facts noticed during our detention near the
west end of Melville Island in 1820 will abundantly testify;
every light air of wind producing, in half an hour&rsquo;s time,
an extraordinary change of current setting at an incredible rate
along the land.</p>
<p>The existence of these variable and irregular currents adds,
of course, very much to the difficulty of determining the true
direction of the flood-tide, the latter being generally much the
weaker of the two, and therefore either wholly counteracted by
the current, or simply tending to accelerate it.&nbsp; On this
account, though I attended very carefully to the subject of the
tides, I cannot pretend to say for certain from what direction
the flood-tide comes on this coast; the impression on my mind,
however, has been, upon the whole, in favour of its flowing from
the southward.&nbsp; The time of high water on the full and
change days of the moon is from half-past eleven to twelve
o&rsquo;clock, being nearly the same as at Port Bowen; but the
tides are so irregular at times, that in the space of three days
the retardation will occasionally not amount to an hour.&nbsp; I
observed, however, that, as the days of full and change, or of
the moon&rsquo;s quarter approached, the irregularity was
corrected, and the time rectified, by some tide of extraordinary
duration.&nbsp; The mean rise and fall was about six feet.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>The weather continuing nearly calm during the 26th, and
the ice keeping at the distance of several miles from the land,
gave us an opportunity of clearing our decks, and stowing the
things belonging to the <i>Fury&rsquo;s</i> crew more comfortably
for their accommodation and convenience.&nbsp; I now felt more
sensibly than ever the necessity I have elsewhere pointed out, of
both ships employed on this kind of service being of the same
size, equipped in the same manner, and alike efficient in every
respect.&nbsp; The way in which we had been able to apply every
article for assisting to heave the <i>Fury</i> down, without the
smallest doubt or selection as to size or strength, proved an
excellent practical example of the value of being thus able, at a
moment&rsquo;s warning, to double the means and resources of
either ship in case of necessity.&nbsp; In fact, by this
arrangement, nothing but a harbour to secure the ships was
wanted, to have completed the whole operation in as effectual a
manner as in a dockyard; for not a shore, or outrigger, or any
other precaution was omitted, that is usually attended to on such
occasions, and all as good and effective as could anywhere have
been desired.&nbsp; The advantages were now scarcely less
conspicuous in the accommodation of the officers and men, who in
a short time became little less comfortable than in their own
ship; whereas, in a smaller vessel, comfort, to say nothing of
health, would have been quite out of the question.&nbsp; Having
thus experienced the incalculable benefit of the establishment
composing this expedition, I am anxious to repeat my conviction
of the advantages that will always be found to attend it in the
equipment of any two ships intended for discovery.</p>
<p>A little snow, which had fallen in the course of the last two
or three days, now remained upon the land, <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>lightly
powdering the higher parts, especially those having a northern
aspect, and creating a much more wintry sensation than the large
broad patches or drifts, which, on all tolerably high land in
these regions, remain undissolved during the whole of each
successive summer.&nbsp; With the exception of a few such patches
here and there, the whole of this coast was now free from snow
before the middle of August.</p>
<p>A breeze from the northward freshening up strong on the 27th,
we stretched over to the eastern shore of Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Inlet, and this with scarcely any obstruction from ice.&nbsp; We
could, indeed, scarcely believe this the same sea which, but a
few weeks before, had been loaded with one impenetrable body of
closely packed ice from shore to shore, and as far as the eye
could discern to the southward.&nbsp; We found this land rather
more covered with the newly fallen snow than that to the
westward; but there was no ice, except the grounded masses,
anywhere along the shore.&nbsp; Having a great deal of heavy work
to do in the re-stowage of the holds which could not well be
accomplished at sea, and also a quantity of water to fill for our
increased complement, I determined to take advantage of our
fetching the entrance of Neill&rsquo;s Harbour to put in here, in
order to prepare the ship completely for crossing the
Atlantic.&nbsp; I was desirous also of ascertaining the depth of
water in this place, which was wanting to complete Lieutenant
Sherer&rsquo;s survey of it.&nbsp; At one P.M., therefore, after
communicating to the officers and ships&rsquo; companies my
intention to return to England, I left the ship, accompanied by
Lieutenant Sherer in a second boat, to obtain the necessary
soundings for conducting the ship to the anchorage, and to lay
down a buoy in the proper berth.&nbsp; Finding the harbour an
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>extremely convenient one for our purpose, we worked the
ship in, and at four P.M. anchored in thirteen fathoms, but
afterwards shifted out to eighteen on a bottom of soft mud.&nbsp;
Almost at the moment of our dropping the anchor, John Page,
seaman of the <i>Fury</i>, departed this life; he had for several
months been affected with a scrofulous disorder, and had been
gradually sinking for some time.</p>
<p>The funeral of the deceased took place after Divine service
had been performed on the 28th; the body being followed to the
grave by a procession of all the officers, seamen, and marines of
both ships, and every solemnity observed which the occasion
demanded.&nbsp; The grave is situated near the beach close to the
anchorage, and a board was placed at the head as a substitute for
a tombstone, having on it a copper-plate with the usual
inscription.</p>
<p>This duty being performed, we immediately commenced landing
the casks and filling water; but notwithstanding the large
streams which, a short time before, had been running into the
harbour, we could hardly obtain enough for our purpose by sinking
a cask with holes in it.&nbsp; I have no doubt that this rapid
dissolution of all the snow on land so high as this, was the
result of an unusually warm summer.&nbsp; This work, together
with the entire re-stowage of all the holds, occupied the whole
of the 29th and 30th; during which time Lieutenant Sherer was
employed in completing the survey of the harbour, more especially
the soundings, which the presence of ice had before
prevented.&nbsp; These arrangements had just been completed when
the north-easterly wind died away, and was succeeded on the
morning of the 31st by a light air from the north-west.&nbsp; As
soon as we had sent to ascertain <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>that the sea
was clear of ice on the outside, and that the breeze which blew
in the harbour was the true one, we weighed and stood out, and
before noon had cleared the shoals at the entrance.</p>
<p>Neill&rsquo;s Harbour, the only one on this eastern coast of
Prince Regent&rsquo;s Inlet, except Port Bowen, to which it is
far superior, corresponds with one of the apparent openings seen
at a distance in 1819, and marked on the chart of that voyage as
a &ldquo;valley or bay.&rdquo;&nbsp; We found it not merely a
convenient place of shelter but a most excellent harbour, with
sufficient space for a great number of ships, and holding-ground
of the best quality, consisting of a tenacious mud of a greenish
colour, in which the flukes of an anchor are entirely
embedded.&nbsp; A great deal of the anchoring ground is entirely
land-locked, and some shoal points which narrow the entrance
would serve to break off any heavy sea from the eastward.&nbsp;
The depth of water in most parts is greater than could be wished,
but several good berths are pointed out in the accompanying
survey made by Lieutenant Sherer.&nbsp; The beach on the west
side is a fine bold one, with four fathoms within twenty yards of
low water mark, and consists of small pebbles of limestone.&nbsp;
The formation of the rocks about the harbour is so similar to
that of Port Bowen that no description of them is
necessary.&nbsp; The harbour may best be known by its latitude;
by the very remarkable flat-topped hill eight miles south of it,
which I have named after Lieutenant Sherer who observed its
latitude; by the high cliffs on the south side of the entrance,
and the comparative low land on the north.&nbsp; The high land is
the more peculiar, as consisting of that very regular horizontal
stratification appearing to be supported by buttresses, which
characterises a large portion of the <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>western shore
of Prince Regent&rsquo;s Inlet, but is not seen on any part of
this coast so well marked as here.&nbsp; It is a remarkable
circumstance, and such as, I believe, very rarely occurs, that
from the point of this land forming the entrance of the harbour
to the southward, and where the cliffs rise at once to a
perpendicular height of not less than five or six hundred feet, a
shoal stretches off to the distance of one-third of a mile,
having from three to eight fathoms upon it.&nbsp; I have reason
to think indeed that there is not more than from ten to fourteen
fathoms anywhere across between this and the low point on the
other side, thus forming a sort of bar, though the depth of water
is much more than sufficient for any ship to pass over.&nbsp; The
latitude of Neill&rsquo;s Harbour is 73&deg; 09&prime; 08&Prime;;
the longitude by chronometers 89&deg; 01&prime; 20&Prime;.8; the
dip of the magnetic needle 88&deg; 08&prime;.25, and the
variation 118&deg; 48&prime; westerly.</p>
<p>I have been thus particular in describing Neill&rsquo;s
Harbour, because I am of opinion that at no very distant period
the whalers may find it of service.&nbsp; The western coast of
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, now an abundant fishery, will probably, like
most others, fail in a few years; for the whales will always in
the course of time leave a place where they continue year after
year to be molested.&nbsp; In that case, Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Inlet will undoubtedly become a rendezvous for our ships, as well
on account of the numerous fish there, as the facility with which
any ship, having once crossed the ice in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, is
sure to reach it during the months of July and August.&nbsp; We
saw nine or ten black whales the evening of our arrival in
Neill&rsquo;s Harbour; these, like most observed hereabouts, and
I believe on the western coast of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay generally,
were somewhat below the middle size.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Finding the wind at north-west in Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Inlet, we were barely able to lie along the eastern coast.&nbsp;
As the breeze freshened in the course of the day, a great deal of
loose ice in extensive streams and patches came drifting down
from the Leopold Islands, occasioning us some trouble in picking
our way to the northward.&nbsp; By carrying a press of sail,
however, we were enabled, towards night, to get into clearer
water, and by four A.M. on the 1st of September, having beat to
windward of a compact body of ice which had fixed itself on the
lee shore about Cape York, we soon came into a perfectly open sea
in Barrow&rsquo;s Strait, and were enabled to bear away to the
eastward.&nbsp; We now considered ourselves fortunate in having
got out of harbour when we did, as the ice would probably have
filled up every inlet on that shore in a few hours after we left
it.</p>
<p>The wind heading us from the eastward on the 2nd, with fog and
wet weather, obliged us to stretch across the Sound, in doing
which we had occasion to remark the more than usual number of
icebergs that occurred in this place, which was abreast of Navy
Board Inlet.&nbsp; Many of these were large and of the long flat
kind, which appear to me to be peculiar to the western coast of
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; I have no doubt that this more than
usual quantity of icebergs in Sir James Lancaster&rsquo;s Sound
was to be attributed to the extraordinary prevalence and strength
of the easterly winds during this summer, which would drive them
from the eastern parts of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; They now
occurred in the proportion of at least four for one that we had
ever before observed here.</p>
<p>Being again favoured with a fair wind, we now stretched to the
eastward, still in an open sea; and our curiosity was
particularly excited to see the present <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>situation of
the ice in the middle of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, and to compare it
with that in 1824.&nbsp; This comparison we were enabled to make
the more fairly, because the season at which we might expect to
come to it coincided, within three or four days, with that in
which we left it the preceding year.&nbsp; The temperature of the
sea-water now increased to 38&deg;, soon after leaving the Sound,
where it had generally been from 33&deg; to 35&deg;, whereas at
the same season last year it rose no higher than 32&deg; anywhere
in the neighbourhood, and remained even so high as that only for
a very short time.&nbsp; This circumstance seemed to indicate the
total absence of ice from those parts of the sea which had last
autumn been wholly covered by it.&nbsp; Accordingly, on the 5th,
being thirty miles beyond the spot in which we had before
contended with numerous difficulties from ice, not a piece was to
be seen, except one or two solitary bergs; and it was not till
the following day, in latitude 72&deg; 45&prime;, and longitude
64&deg; 44&prime;, or about one hundred and twenty-seven miles to
the eastward of where we made our escape on the 9th of September,
1824, that we fell in with a body of ice so loose and open as
scarcely to oblige us to alter our course for it.&nbsp; At three
P.M. on the 7th, being in latitude 72&deg; 30&prime;, and
longitude 60&deg; 05&prime;, and having, in the course of eighty
miles that we had run through it, only made a single tack, we
came to the margin of the ice, and got into an open sea on its
eastern side.&nbsp; In the whole course of this distance the ice
was so much spread, that it would not, if at all closely
&ldquo;packed,&rdquo; have occupied one-third of the same
space.&nbsp; There were at this time thirty-nine bergs in sight,
and some of them certainly not less than two hundred feet in
height.</p>
<p>The narrowness and openness of the ice at this season, <!--
page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>between the parallels of 73&deg; and 74&deg;, when
compared with its extent and closeness about the same time the
preceding year, was a decided confirmation, if any were wanting,
that the summer of 1824 was extremely unfavourable for
penetrating to the westward about the usual latitudes.&nbsp; How
it had proved elsewhere we could not of course conjecture, till,
on the 8th, being in latitude 71&deg; 55&prime;, longitude
60&deg; 30&prime;, and close to the margin of the ice, we fell in
with the <i>Alfred</i>, <i>Ellison</i>, and <i>Elizabeth</i>,
whalers of Hull, all running to the northward, even at this
season, to look for whales.&nbsp; From them we learned that the
<i>Ellison</i> was one of the two ships we saw, when beset in the
&ldquo;pack&rdquo; on the 18th July, 1824; and that they were
then, as we had conjectured, on their return from the northward,
in consequence of having failed in effecting a passage to the
westward.&nbsp; The master of the <i>Ellison</i> informed us
that, after continuing their course along the margin of the ice
to the southward, they at length passed through it to the western
land without any difficulty, in the latitude of 68&deg; to
69&deg;.&nbsp; Many other ships had also crossed about the same
parallels, even in three or four days; but none, it seemed, had
succeeded in doing so, as usual, to the northward.&nbsp; Thus it
plainly appeared (and I need not hesitate to confess that to me
the information was satisfactory) that our bad success in pushing
across the ice in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay in 1824, had been caused by
circumstances neither to be foreseen nor controlled; namely, by a
particular position of the ice, which, according to the best
information I have been able to collect, has never before
occurred during the only six years that it has been customary for
the whalers to cross this ice at all, and which, therefore, in
all probability, will seldom occur again.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>If we seek for a cause for the ice thus hanging with
more than ordinary tenacity to the northward, the comparative
coldness of the season indicated by our meteorological
observations may perhaps be considered sufficient to furnish
it.&nbsp; For as the annual clearing of the northern parts of
Baffin&rsquo;s Bay depends entirely on the time of the disruption
of the ice, and the rate at which it is afterwards drifted to the
southward by the excess of northerly winds, any circumstance
tending to retain it in the bays and inlets to a later period
than usual, and subsequently to hold it together in large floes,
which drive more slowly than smaller masses, would undoubtedly
produce the effect in question.&nbsp; There is, at all events,
one useful practical inference to be drawn from what has been
stated, which is that, though perhaps in a considerable majority
of years a northern latitude may prove the most favourable for
crossing in, yet seasons will sometimes intervene in which it
will be a matter of great uncertainty whereabouts to make the
attempt with the best hope of success.</p>
<p>As the whaling ships were not homeward bound, having as yet
had indifferent success in the fishery, I did not consider it
necessary to send despatches by them.&nbsp; After an hour&rsquo;s
communication with them, and obtaining such information of a
public nature as could not fail to be highly interesting to us,
we made sail to the southward: while we observed them lying-to
for some time after, probably to consult respecting the unwelcome
information with which we had furnished them as to the whales,
not one of which, by some extraordinary chance, we had seen since
leaving Neill&rsquo;s Harbour.&nbsp; As this circumstance was
entirely new to us, it seems not unlikely that the whales are
already beginning to shift their ground, in <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>consequence
of the increased attacks which have been made upon them of late
years in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the 10th we had an easterly wind, which, gradually
freshening to a gale, drew up the Strait from the southward, and
blew strong for twenty-four hours from that quarter.&nbsp; In the
course of the night, and while lying-to under the storm-sails, an
iceberg was discovered, by its white appearance, under our
lee.&nbsp; The main-topsail being thrown aback we were enabled to
drop clear of this immense body, which would have been a
dangerous neighbour in a heavy seaway.&nbsp; The wind moderated
on the 11th, but on the following day another gale came on, which
for nine or ten hours blew in most tremendous gusts from the same
quarter, and raised a heavy sea.&nbsp; We happily came near no
ice during the night, or it would scarcely have been possible to
keep the ship clear of it.&nbsp; It abated after daylight on the
13th, but continued to blow an ordinary gale for twelve hours
longer.&nbsp; It was remarkable that the weather was extremely
clear overhead during the whole of this last gale, which is very
unusual here with a southerly wind.&nbsp; Being favoured with a
northerly breeze on the 15th we began to make some way to the
southward.&nbsp; From nine A.M. to one P.M. a change of
temperature in the sea water took place from 37&deg; to
33&deg;.&nbsp; This circumstance seemed to indicate our approach
to some ice projecting to the eastward beyond the straight and
regular margin of the &ldquo;pack,&rdquo; which was at this time
not in sight.&nbsp; The indication proved correct and useful; for
after passing several loose pieces of ice during the night, on
the morning of the 15th, just at daybreak, we came to a
considerable body of it, through which we continued to run to the
southward.&nbsp; We were now in latitude 68&deg; 56&prime;, and
in longitude 58&deg; 27&prime;, in which <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>situation a
great many bergs were in sight, and apparently aground.&nbsp; We
ran through this ice, which was very heavy, but loose and much
broken up, the whole day; when having sailed fifty-three miles
S.S.E., and appearances being the same as ever, we hauled to the
E.S.E., to endeavour to get clear before dark, which we were just
enabled to effect after a run of thirty miles in that direction,
and then bore up to the southward.&nbsp; After this we saw but
one iceberg and one heavy loose piece previous to our clearing
Davis&rsquo;s Strait.</p>
<p>On the 17th at noon we had passed to the southward of the
Arctic Circle, and from this latitude to that of about 58&deg; we
had favourable winds and weather; but we remarked on this, as on
several other occasions during this season, that a northerly
breeze, contrary to ordinary observation, brought more moisture
with it than any other.&nbsp; In the course of this run we also
observed more drift-wood than we had ever done before, which I
thought might possibly be owing to the very great prevalence of
easterly winds this season driving it further from the coast of
Greenland than usual.&nbsp; We saw very large flocks of
kittiwakes, some of the whales called finners, and, as we
supposed, a few also of the black kind, together with multitudes
of porpoises.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, notwithstanding the continuance of
a favourable breeze, we met, in the latitude of 58&frac12;&deg;,
so heavy a swell from the north-eastward as to make the ship
labour violently for four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; The northerly
wind then dying away was succeeded by a light air from the
eastward with constant rain.&nbsp; A calm then followed for
several hours, causing the ship to roll heavily in the hollow of
the sea.&nbsp; On the morning of the 25th we had again an
easterly wind, <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>which in a few hours reduced us to
the close-reefed topsails and reefed courses.&nbsp; At eight P.M.
it freshened to a gale, which brought us under the main-topsail
and storm-staysails, and at seven the following morning it
increased to a gale of such violence from N.E.b.N. as does not
very often occur at sea in these latitudes.&nbsp; The gusts were
at times so tremendous as to set the sea quite in a foam, and
threatened to tear the sails out of the bolt-ropes.&nbsp; It
abated a little for four hours in the evening, but from nine P.M.
till two the following morning blew with as great violence as
before, with a high sea, and very heavy rain; constituting
altogether as inclement weather as can well be conceived for
about eighteen hours.&nbsp; The wind gradually drew to the
westward, with dry weather, after the gale began to abate, and at
six A.M. we were enabled to bear up and run to the eastward with
a strong gale at north-west.</p>
<p>The indications of the barometer previous to and during this
gale deserve to be noticed, because it is only about Cape
Farewell that, in coming from the northward down Davis&rsquo;s
Strait, this instrument begins to speak a language which has ever
been intelligible to us as a weather-glass.&nbsp; As it is also
certain that a &ldquo;stormy spirit&rdquo; resides in the
neighbourhood of this headland, no less than in that of more
famed ones to the south, it may become a matter of no small
practical utility for ships passing it, especially in the autumn,
to attend to the oscillations of the mercurial column.&nbsp; It
is with this impression alone that I have detailed the otherwise
uninteresting circumstances of the inclement weather we now
experienced here; and which was accompanied by the following
indications of the barometer.&nbsp; On the 24th, notwithstanding
the change of wind from north to east, <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the mercury
rose from 29.51 on that morning, to 29.72 at three A.M. the
following day, but fell to 29.39 by nine P.M., with the strong
but not violent breeze then blowing.&nbsp; After this it
continued to descend very gradually, and had reached 28.84, which
was its minimum, at three P.M. on the 26th, after which it
continued to blow tremendously hard for eleven or twelve hours,
the mercury uniformly though slowly ascending to 28.95 during
that interval, and afterwards to 29.73 as the weather became
moderate and fine in the course of the three following days.</p>
<p>After this gale the atmosphere seemed to be quite cleared, and
we enjoyed a week of such remarkably fine weather as seldom
occurs at this season of the year.&nbsp; We had then a succession
of strong southerly winds, but were enabled to continue our
progress to the eastward, so as to make Mould Head, towards the
north-west end of the Orkney Islands, at daylight on the 10th of
October; and the wind becoming more westerly we rounded North
Ronaldsha Island at noon, and then shaped a course for
Buchaness.</p>
<p>In running down Davis&rsquo;s Strait, as well as in crossing
the Atlantic, we saw on this passage as well as in all our former
autumnal ones, a good deal of the Aurora Borealis.&nbsp; It first
began to display itself on the 15th of September, about the
latitude of 69&frac12;&deg;, appearing in the (true) south-east
quarter as a bright luminous patch five or six degrees above the
horizon, almost stationary for two or three hours together, but
frequently altering its intensity, and occasionally sending up
vivid streamers towards the zenith.&nbsp; It appeared in the same
manner on several subsequent nights in the south-west, west, and
east quarters of the heavens; and on the 20th a bright arch of it
passed across the zenith from S.E. to N.W., appearing to be very
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>close to the ship, and affording so strong a light as
to throw the shadow of objects on the deck.&nbsp; The next
brilliant display, however, of this beautiful phenomenon which we
now witnessed, and which far surpassed anything of the kind
observed at Port Bowen, occurred on the night of the 24th of
September, in latitude 58&frac12;&deg;, longitude
44&frac12;&deg;.&nbsp; It first appeared in a (true) east
direction, in detached masses like luminous clouds of yellow or
sulphur-coloured light, about three degrees above the
horizon.&nbsp; When this appearance had continued for about an
hour, it began at nine P.M. to spread upwards, and gradually
extended itself into a narrow band of light passing through the
zenith and again downwards to the western horizon.&nbsp; Soon
after this the streams of light seemed no longer to emanate from
the eastward, but from a fixed point about one degree above the
horizon on a true west bearing.&nbsp; From this point, as from
the narrow point of a funnel, streams of light, resembling
brightly illuminated vapour or smoke, appeared to be incessantly
issuing, increasing in breadth as they proceeded, and darting
with inconceivable velocity, such as the eye could scarcely keep
pace with, upwards towards the zenith, and in the same easterly
direction which the former arch had taken.&nbsp; The sky
immediately under the spot from which the light issued appeared,
by a deception very common in this phenomenon, to be covered with
a dark cloud, whose outline the imagination might at times
convert into that of the summit of a mountain, from which the
light proceeded like the flames of a volcano.&nbsp; The streams
of light as they were projected upwards did not consist of
continuous vertical columns or streamers, but almost entirely of
separate, though constantly renewed masses, which seemed to roll
themselves <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>laterally onward with a sort of
undulating motion, constituting what I have understood to be
meant by that modification of the Aurora called the &ldquo;merry
dancers,&rdquo; which is seen in beautiful perfection at the
Shetland Islands.&nbsp; The general colour of the light was
yellow, but an orange and a greenish tinge were at times very
distinctly perceptible, the intensity of the light and colours
being always the greatest when occupying the smallest
space.&nbsp; Thus the lateral margins of the band or arch seemed
at times to roll themselves inwards so as to approach each other,
and in this case the light just at the edges became much more
vivid than the rest.&nbsp; The intensity of light during the
brightest part of the phenomenon, which continued three-quarters
of an hour, could scarcely be inferior to that of the moon when
full.</p>
<p>We once more remarked in crossing the Atlantic that the Aurora
often gave a great deal of light at night, even when the sky was
entirely overcast, and it was on that account impossible to say
from what part of the heavens the light proceeded, though it was
often fully equal to that afforded by the moon in her
quarters.&nbsp; This was rendered particularly striking on the
night of the 5th of October, in consequence of the frequent and
almost instantaneous changes which took place in this way, the
weather being rather dark and gloomy, but the sky at times so
brightly illuminated, almost in an instant, as to give quite as
much light as the full moon similarly clouded, and enabling one
distinctly to recognise persons from one end of the ship to the
other.&nbsp; We did not on any one occasion perceive the
compasses to be affected by the Aurora Borealis.</p>
<p>As we approached the Orkneys, I demanded from the officers, in
compliance with my instructions from my <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, all the logs, journals, drawings,
and charts, which had been made during the voyage.&nbsp; After
rounding the north end of the Orkneys on the 10th of October, we
were on the 12th met by a strong southerly wind when off
Peterhead.&nbsp; I, therefore, immediately landed (for the second
time) at that place; and, setting off without delay for London,
arrived at the Admiralty on the 16th.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the ill success which had attended our late
efforts, it may in some degree be imagined what gratification I
experienced at this time in seeing the whole of the
<i>Hecla&rsquo;s</i> crew, and also those of the <i>Fury</i>
(with the two exceptions already mentioned), return to their
native country in as good health as when they left it eighteen
months before.&nbsp; The <i>Hecla</i> arrived at Sheerness on the
20th of October, where she was detained for a few days for the
purpose of Captain Hoppner, his officers, and ship&rsquo;s
company, being put upon their trial (according to the customary
and indispensable rule in such cases) for the loss of the
<i>Fury</i>; when, it is scarcely necessary to add, they received
an honourable acquittal.&nbsp; The <i>Hecla</i> then proceeded to
Woolwich, and was paid off on the 21st of November.</p>
<h3><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>ACCOUNT OF THE ESQUIMAUX OF MELVILLE
PENINSULA AND THE ADJOINING ISLANDS,</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">More particularly of Winter Island and
Igloolik.</p>
<p>The number of individuals composing the tribe of Esquimaux
assembled at Winter Island and Igloolik was two hundred and
nineteen, of whom sixty-nine were men, seventy-seven women, and
seventy-three children.&nbsp; Two or three of the men, from their
appearance and infirmities, as well as from the age of their
children, must have been near seventy; the rest were from twenty
to about fifty.&nbsp; The majority of the women were
comparatively young, or from twenty to five-and-thirty, and three
or four only seemed to have reached sixty.&nbsp; Of the children,
about one-third were under four years old, and the rest from that
age upwards to sixteen or seventeen.&nbsp; Out of one hundred and
fifty-five individuals who passed the winter at Igloolik, we knew
of eighteen deaths and of only nine births.</p>
<p>The stature of these people is much below that of Europeans in
general.&nbsp; One man, who was unusually tall, measured five
feet ten inches, and the shortest was only four feet eleven
inches and a half.&nbsp; Of twenty individuals of each sex
measured at Igloolik, the range was:&mdash;</p>
<p>Men.&mdash;From 5 ft. 10 in. to 4 ft. 11 in.&nbsp; The average
height, 5 ft. 5&#8531; in.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Women.&mdash;From 5 ft. 3&frac12; in. to 4 ft.
8&frac34; in.&nbsp; The average height, 5 ft. &frac12;in.</p>
<p>The women, however, generally appear shorter than they really
are, both from the unwieldy nature of their clothes and from a
habit, which they early acquire, of stooping considerably forward
in order to balance the weight of the child they carry in their
hood.</p>
<p>In their figure they are rather well-formed than
otherwise.&nbsp; Their knees are indeed rather large in
proportion, but their legs are straight, and the hands and feet,
in both sexes, remarkably small.&nbsp; The younger individuals
were all plump, but none of them corpulent; the women inclined
the most to this last extreme, and their flesh was, even in the
youngest individuals, quite loose and without firmness.</p>
<p>Their faces are generally round and full, eyes small and
black, nose also small and sunk far in between the cheek bones,
but not much flattened.&nbsp; It is remarkable that one man,
<i>T&#275;-&#259;</i>, his brother, his wife, and two daughters
had good Roman noses, and one of the latter was an extremely
pretty young woman.&nbsp; Their teeth are short, thick, and
close, generally regular, and in the young persons almost always
white.&nbsp; The elderly women were still well furnished in this
way, though their teeth were usually a good deal worn down,
probably by the habit of chewing the seal-skins for making
boots.</p>
<p>In the young of both sexes the complexion is clear and
transparent, and the skin smooth.&nbsp; The colour of the latter,
when divested of oil and dirt, is scarcely a shade darker than
that of a deep brunette, so that the blood is plainly perceptible
when it mounts into the cheeks.&nbsp; In the old folks, whose
faces were much wrinkled, the skin appears of a much more dingy
hue, the dirt being less <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>easily, and
therefore less frequently, dislodged from them.&nbsp; Besides the
smallness of their eyes, there are two peculiarities in this
feature common to almost all of them.&nbsp; The first consists in
the eye not being horizontal as with us, but coming much lower at
the end next the nose than at the other.&nbsp; Of the second an
account by Mr. Edwards will be given in another place.</p>
<p>By whatever peculiarities, however, they may in general be
distinguished, they are by no means ill-looking people; and there
were among them three or four grown-up persons of each sex who,
when divested of their skin-dresses, their tattooing, and, above
all, of their dirt, might have been considered pleasing-looking,
if not handsome, people in any town in Europe.&nbsp; This remark
applies more generally to the children also; several of whom had
complexions nearly as fair as that of Europeans, and whose little
bright black eyes gave a fine expression to their
countenances.</p>
<p>The hair both of males and females is black, glossy, and
straight.&nbsp; The men usually wear it rather long, and allow it
to hang about their heads in a loose and slovenly manner.&nbsp; A
few of the younger men, and especially those who had been about
the shores of the <i>Welcome</i>, had it cut straight upon the
forehead, and two or three had a circular patch upon the crown of
the head, where the hair was quite short and thin, somewhat after
the manner of Capuchin friars.&nbsp; The women pride themselves
extremely on the length and thickness of their hair; and it was
not without reluctance on their part, and the same on that of
their husbands, that they were induced to dispose of any of
it.&nbsp; When inclined to be neat they separate their locks into
two equal parts, one of which hangs on each side of their heads
and in front of their shoulders.&nbsp; To <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>stiffen and
bind these they use a narrow strap of deerskin attached at one
end to a round piece of bone, fourteen inches long, tapered to a
point, and covered over with leather.&nbsp; This looks like a
little whip, the handle of which is placed up and down the hair,
and the strap wound round it in a number of spiral turns, making
the tail thus equipped very much resemble one of those formerly
worn by our seamen.&nbsp; The strap of this article of dress,
which is altogether called a <i>t&#335;gl&#275;&#275;g&#259;</i>,
is so made from the deerskin as to show, when bound round the
hair, alternate turns of white and dark fur, which give it a very
neat and ornamental appearance.&nbsp; On ordinary occasions it is
considered slovenly not to have the hair thus dressed, and the
neatest of the women never visited the ships without it.&nbsp;
Those who are less nice dispose their hair into a loose plait on
each side, or have one <i>t&#335;gl&#275;&#275;g&#259;</i> and
one plait; and others again, wholly disregarding the business of
the toilet, merely tucked their hair in under the breast of their
jackets.&nbsp; Some of the women&rsquo;s hair was tolerably fine,
but would not in this respect bear a comparison with that of an
Englishwoman.&nbsp; In both sexes it is full of vermin, which
they are in the constant habit of picking out and eating; a man
and his wife will sit for an hour together performing for each
other that friendly office.&nbsp; The women have a comb, which,
however, seems more intended for ornament than use, as we seldom
or never observed them comb their hair.&nbsp; When a
woman&rsquo;s husband is ill she wears her hair loose, and cuts
it off as a sign of mourning if he dies&mdash;a custom agreeing
with that of the Greenlanders.&nbsp; It is probable also, from
what has been before said, that some opprobrium is attached to
the loss of a woman&rsquo;s hair when no such occasion demands
this sacrifice.&nbsp; The men wear the hair on the upper lip and
<!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>chin, from an inch to an inch and a half in length, and
some were distinguished by a little tuft between the chin and
lower lip.</p>
<p>The dresses both of male and female are composed almost
entirely of deer-skin, in which respect they differ from those of
most Esquimaux before met with.&nbsp; In the form of the dress
they vary very little from those so repeatedly described.&nbsp;
The jacket, which is close, but not tight, all round, comes as
low as the hips, and has sleeves reaching to the wrist.&nbsp; In
that of the women, the tail or flap behind is very broad, and so
long as almost to touch the ground; while a shorter and narrower
one before reaches half-way down the thigh.&nbsp; The men have
also a tail in the hind part of their jacket, but of smaller
dimensions; but before it is generally straight or ornamented by
a single scollop.&nbsp; The hood of the jacket, which forms the
only covering for their head, is much the largest in that of the
women, for the purpose of holding a child.&nbsp; The back of the
jacket also bulges out in the middle to give the child a footing,
and a strap or girdle below this, and secured round the waist by
two large wooden buttons in front, prevents the infant from
falling through, when, the hood being in use, it is necessary
thus to deposit it.&nbsp; The sleeves of the women&rsquo;s
jackets are made more square and loose about the shoulders than
those of the men, for the convenience, as we understood, of more
readily depositing a child in the hood; and they have a habit of
slipping their arms out of them, and keeping them in contact with
their bodies for the sake of warmth, just as we do with our
fingers in our gloves in very cold weather.</p>
<p>In winter every individual, when in the open air, wears two
jackets, of which the outer one
(<i>C&#257;pp&#277;-t&#275;gg&#259;</i>) has the hair outside,
and the inner one (<i>Att&#275;&#275;g&#259;</i>) next the <!--
page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>body.&nbsp; Immediately on entering the hut the men
take off their outer jacket, beat the snow from it, and lay it
by.&nbsp; The upper garment of the females, besides being cut
according to a regular and uniform pattern, and sewed with
exceeding neatness, which is the case with all the dresses of
these people, has also the flaps ornamented in a very becoming
manner by a neat border of deer-skin, so arranged as to display
alternate breadths of white and dark fur.&nbsp; This is,
moreover, usually beautified by a handsome fringe, consisting of
innumerable long narrow threads of leather hanging down from
it.&nbsp; This ornament is not uncommon also in the outer jackets
of the men.&nbsp; When seal-hunting they fasten up the tails of
their jackets with a button behind.</p>
<p>Their breeches, of which in winter they also wear two pairs,
and similarly disposed as to the fur, reach below the knee, and
fasten with a string drawn tight round the waist.&nbsp; Though
these have little or no waist-band, and do not come very high,
the depth of the jackets, which considerably overlap them, serves
very effectually to complete the covering of the body.</p>
<p>Their legs and feet are so well clothed, that no degree of
cold can well affect them.&nbsp; When a man goes on a sealing
excursion he first puts on a pair of deer-skin boots
(<i>All&#277;kt&#275;&#275;g&#259;</i>) with the hair inside and
reaching to the knee, where they tie.&nbsp; Over these come a
pair of shoes of the same material; next a pair of dressed
seal-skin boots perfectly water-tight; and over all a
corresponding pair of shoes, tying round the instep.&nbsp; These
last are made just like the moccasin of a North American Indian,
being neatly crimped at the toes, and having several serpentine
pieces of hide sewn across the sole to prevent wearing.&nbsp; The
water-tight boots and shoes are made of <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>the skin of
the small seal (<i>neitiek</i>), except the soles, which consist
of the skin of the large seal (<i>oguke</i>); this last is also
used for their fishing-lines.&nbsp; When the men are not prepared
to encounter wet they wear an outer boot of deer-skin with the
hair outside.</p>
<p>The inner boot of the women, unlike that of the men, is loose
round the leg, coming as high as the knee-joint behind, and in
front carried up, by a long pointed flap, nearly to the waist,
and there fastened to the breeches.&nbsp; The upper boot, with
the hair as usual outside, corresponds with the other in shape,
except that it is much more full, especially on the outer side,
where it bulges out so preposterously as to give the women the
most awkward, bow-legged appearance imaginable.&nbsp; This
superfluity of boot has probably originated in the custom, still
common among the native women of Labrador, of carrying their
children in them.&nbsp; We were told that these women sometimes
put their children there to sleep; but the custom must be rare
among them, as we never saw it practised.&nbsp; These boots,
however, form their principal pockets, and pretty capacious ones
they are.&nbsp; Here, also, as in the jackets, considerable taste
is displayed in the selection of different parts of the
deer-skin, alternate strips of dark and white being placed up and
down the sides and front by way of ornament.&nbsp; The women also
wear a moccasin (<i>Itteeg&#277;g&#259;</i>) over all in the
winter time.</p>
<p>One or two persons used to wear a sort of ruff round the neck,
composed of the longest white hair of the deerskin, hanging down
over the bosom in a manner very becoming to young people.&nbsp;
It seemed to afford so little additional warmth to persons
already well clothed, that I am inclined rather to attribute
their wearing it to some superstitious notion.&nbsp; The children
between two and <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>eight or nine years of age had a
pair of breeches and boots united in one, with braces over their
shoulders to keep them up.&nbsp; These, with a jacket like the
others and a pair of deer-skin mittens, with which each
individual is furnished, constitute the whole of their
dress.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s clothes are often made of the skins
of very young fawns and of the marmot, as being softer than those
of the deer.</p>
<p>The Esquimaux, when thus equipped, may at all times bid
defiance to the rigour of this inhospitable climate; and nothing
can exceed the comfortable appearance which they exhibit even in
the most inclement weather.&nbsp; When seen at a little distance
the white rim of their hoods, whitened still more by the breath
collecting and freezing upon it, and contrasted with the dark
faces which they encircle, render them very grotesque objects;
but while the skin of their dresses continues in good condition
they always look clean and wholesome.</p>
<p>To judge by the eagerness with which the women received our
beads, especially small white ones, as well as any other article
of that kind, we might suppose them very fond of personal
ornament.&nbsp; Yet of all that they obtained from us in this way
at Winter Island, scarcely anything ever made its appearance
again during our stay there, except a ring or two on the finger,
and some bracelets of beads round the wrist: the latter of these
was probably considered as a charm of some kind or other.&nbsp;
We found among them, at the time of our first intercourse, a
number of small black and white glass beads, disposed alternately
on a string of sinew, and worn in this manner.&nbsp; They would
also sometimes hang a small bunch of these, or a button or two,
in front of their jackets and hair; and many of them, in the
course of the <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>second winter, covered the whole
front of their jackets with the beads they received from us.</p>
<p>The most common ornament of this kind, exclusively their own,
consists in strings of teeth, sometimes many hundred in number,
which are either attached to the lower part of the jacket, like
the fringe before described, or fastened as a belt round the
waist.&nbsp; Most of these teeth are of the fox and wolf, but
some also belong to the musk-ox
(<i>&#333;&#333;m&#301;ngm&#365;k</i>), of which animal, though
it is never seen at Winter Island, we procured from the Esquimaux
several of the grinders and a quantity of the hair and
skin.&nbsp; The bones of the
<i>k&#257;bl&#277;&#277;-&#257;rioo</i>, supposed to be the
wolverine, constitute another of their ornaments; and it is more
than probable that all these possess some imaginary qualities, as
specific charms for various purposes.&nbsp; The most
extraordinary amulet, if it be one, of this kind was a row of
foxes&rsquo; noses attached to the fore-part of a woman&rsquo;s
jacket like a tier of black buttons.&nbsp; I purchased from
Iligliuk a semicircular ornament of brass, serrated at the upper
edge and brightly polished, which she wore over her hair in front
and which was very becoming.&nbsp; The handsomest thing of this
kind, however, was understood to be worn on the head by men,
though we did not learn on what occasions.&nbsp; It consisted of
a band two inches in breadth, composed of several strips of skin
sewn together, alternately black and yellow; near the upper edge
some hair was artfully interwoven, forming with the skin a very
pretty chequer-work: along the lower edge were suspended more
than a hundred small teeth, principally of the deer, neatly
fastened by small double tags of sinew, and forming a very
appropriate fringe.</p>
<p>Among their personal ornaments must also be reckoned <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>that mode of marking the body called tattooing, which,
of the customs not essential to the comfort or happiness of
mankind, is perhaps the most extensively practised throughout the
world.&nbsp; Among those people it seems to be an ornament of
indispensable importance to the women, not one of them being
without it.&nbsp; The operation is performed about the age of
ten, or sometimes earlier, and has nothing to do with marriage,
except that, being considered in the light of a personal charm,
it may serve to recommend them as wives.&nbsp; The parts of the
body thus marked are their faces, arms, hands, thighs, and in
some few women the breasts, but never the feet as in
Greenland.&nbsp; The operation, which by way of curiosity most of
our gentlemen had practised on their arms, is very expeditiously
managed by passing a needle and thread (the latter covered with
lamp-black and oil) under the epidermis, according to a pattern
previously marked out upon the skin.&nbsp; Several stitches being
thus taken at once, the thumb is pressed upon the part while the
thread is drawn through, by which means the colouring matter is
retained, and a permanent dye of a blue tinge imparted to the
skin.&nbsp; A woman expert at this business will perform it very
quickly and with great regularity, but seldom without drawing
blood in many places, and occasioning some inflammation.&nbsp;
Where so large a portion of the surface of the body is to be
covered, it must become a painful as well as tedious process,
especially as, for want of needles, they often use a strip of
whalebone as a substitute.&nbsp; For those parts where a needle
cannot conveniently be passed under the skin they use the method
by puncture, which is common in other countries, and by which our
seamen frequently mark their hands and arms.&nbsp; Several of the
men were marked on the back part of <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>their
hands; and with them we understood it to be considered as a
souvenir of some distant or deceased person who had performed
it.</p>
<p>In their winter habitations, I have before mentioned that the
only materials employed are snow and ice, the latter being made
use of for the windows alone.&nbsp; The work is commenced by
cutting from a drift of hard and compact snow a number of oblong
slabs, six or seven inches thick and about two feet in length,
and laying them edgeways on a level spot, also covered with snow,
in a circular form, and of a diameter from eight to fifteen feet,
proportioned to the number of occupants the hut is to
contain.&nbsp; Upon this as a foundation is laid a second tier of
the same kind, but with the pieces inclining a little inwards,
and made to fit closely to the lower slabs and to each other, by
running a knife adroitly along the under part and sides.&nbsp;
The top of this tier is now prepared for the reception of a third
by squaring it off smoothly with a knife, all which is
dexterously performed by one man standing within the circle and
receiving the blocks of snow from those employed in cutting them
without.&nbsp; When the wall has attained a height of four or
five feet, it leans so much inward as to appear as if about to
tumble every moment; but the workmen still fearlessly lay their
blocks of snow upon it, until it is too high any longer to
furnish the materials to the builder in this manner.&nbsp; Of
this he gives notice by cutting a hole close to the ground in
that part where the door is intended to be, which is near the
south side, and through this the snow is now passed.&nbsp; Thus
they continue till they have brought the sides nearly to meet in
a perfect and well-constructed dome, sometimes nine or ten feet
high in the centre; and this they take considerable <!-- page
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>care in finishing, by fitting the last block or
keystone very nicely in the centre, dropping it into its place
from the outside, though it is still done by the man
within.&nbsp; The people outside are in the meantime occupied in
throwing up snow with the <i>p&#335;o&#257;ll&#277;r&#257;y</i>,
or snow-shovel, and in stuffing in little wedges of snow where
holes have been accidentally left.</p>
<p>The builder next proceeds to let himself out by enlarging the
proposed doorway into the form of a Gothic arch three feet high,
and two feet and a half wide at the bottom, communicating with
which they construct two passages, each from ten to twelve feet
long and from four to five feet in height, the lowest being that
next the hut.&nbsp; The roofs of these passages are sometimes
arched, but more generally made flat by slabs laid on
horizontally.&nbsp; In first digging the snow for building the
hut, they take it principally from the part where the passages
are to be made, which purposely brings the floor of the latter
considerably lower than that of the hut, but in no part do they
dig till the bare ground appears.</p>
<p>The work just described completes the walls of a hut, if a
single apartment only be required; but if, on account of
relationship, or from any other cause, several families are to
reside under one roof, the passages are made common to all, and
the first apartment (in that case made smaller) forms a kind of
ante-chamber, from which you go through an arched doorway, five
feet high, into the inhabited apartments.&nbsp; When there are
three of these, which is generally the case, the whole building,
with its adjacent passages, forms a tolerably regular cross.</p>
<p>For the admission of light into the huts a round hole is cut
on one side of the roof of each apartment, and a circular plate
of ice, three or four inches thick and two <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>feet in
diameter, let into it.&nbsp; The light is soft and pleasant, like
that transmitted through ground glass, and is quite sufficient
for every purpose.&nbsp; When after some time these edifices
become surrounded by drift, it is only by the windows, as I have
before remarked, that they could be recognised as human
habitations.&nbsp; It may, perhaps, then be imagined how singular
is their external appearance at night, when they discover
themselves only by a circular disc of light transmitted through
the windows from the lamps within.</p>
<p>The next thing to be done is to raise a bank of snow, two and
a half feet high, all round the interior of each apartment,
except on the side next the door.&nbsp; This bank, which is
neatly squared off, forms their beds and fireplace, the former
occupying the sides, and the latter the end opposite the
door.&nbsp; The passage left open up to the fireplace is between
three and four feet wide.&nbsp; The beds are arranged by first
covering the snow with a quantity of small stones, over which are
laid their paddles, tent-poles, and some blades of whalebone;
above these they place a number of little pieces of network, made
of thin slips of whalebone, and, lastly, a quantity of twigs of
birch and of the <i>andromeda tetragona</i>.&nbsp; Their
deer-skins, which are very numerous, can now be spread without
risk of their touching the snow; and such a bed is capable of
affording not merely comfort but luxurious repose, in spite of
the rigour of the climate.&nbsp; The skins thus used as blankets
are made of a large size, and bordered, like some of the jackets,
with a fringe of long narrow slips of leather, in which state a
blanket is called <i>k&#275;ipik</i>.</p>
<p>The fire belonging to each family consists of a single lamp,
or shallow vessel of <i>lapis ollaris</i>, its form being the
lesser segment of a circle.&nbsp; The wick, composed of <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>dry moss rubbed between the hands till it is quite
inflammable, is disposed along the edge of the lamp on the
straight side, and a greater or smaller quantity lighted,
according to the heat required or the fuel that can be
afforded.&nbsp; When the whole length of this, which is sometimes
above eighteen inches, is kindled, it affords a most brilliant
and beautiful light, without any perceptible smoke or any
offensive smell.&nbsp; The lamp is made to supply itself with
oil, by suspending a long thin slice of whale, seal, or sea-horse
blubber near the flame, the warmth of which causes the oil to
drip into the vessel until the whole is extracted.&nbsp;
Immediately over the lamp is fixed a rude and rickety framework
of wood, from which their pots are suspended, and serving also to
sustain a large hoop of bone, having a net stretched tight within
it.&nbsp; This contrivance, called <i>Inn&#277;t&#259;t</i>, is
intended for the reception of any wet things, and is usually
loaded with boots, shoes, and mittens.</p>
<p>The fireplace, just described as situated at the upper end of
the apartment, has always two lamps facing different ways, one
for each family occupying the corresponding bed-place.&nbsp;
There is frequently also a smaller and less-pretending
establishment on the same model&mdash;lamp, pot, net, and
all&mdash;in one of the corners next the door; for one apartment
sometimes contains three families, which are always closely
related, and no married woman, or even a widow without children,
is without her separate fireplace.</p>
<p>With all the lamps lighted and the hut full of people and
dogs, a thermometer placed on the net over the fire indicated a
temperature of 38&deg;; when removed two or three feet from this
situation it fell to 31&deg;, and placed close to the wall stood
at 23&deg;, the temperature of the open <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>air at the
time being 25&deg; below zero.&nbsp; A greater degree of warmth
than this produces extreme inconvenience by the dropping from the
roofs.&nbsp; This they endeavour to obviate by applying a little
piece of snow to the place from which a drop proceeds, and this
adhering is for a short time an effectual remedy; but for several
weeks in the spring, when the weather is too warm for these
edifices, and still too cold for tents, they suffer much on this
account.</p>
<p>The most important perhaps of the domestic utensils, next to
the lamp already described, are the
<i>&#333;&#333;tk&#335;&#335;s&#277;&#277;ks</i> or stone pots
for cooking.&nbsp; These are hollowed out of solid <i>lapis
ollaris</i>, of an oblong form, wider at the top than at the
bottom, all made in similar proportion, though of various sizes,
corresponding with the dimensions of the lamp which burns under
it.&nbsp; The pot is suspended by a line of sinew at each end to
the framework over the fire, and thus becomes so black on every
side that the original colour of the stone is in no part
discernible.&nbsp; Many of them were cracked quite across in
several places, and mended by sewing with sinew or rivets of
copper, iron, or lead, so as, with the assistance of a lashing
and a due proportion of dirt, to render them quite
water-tight.&nbsp; I may here remark that as these people
distinguish the Wager River by the name of
<i>O&#333;tk&#335;&#335;s&#277;&#277;ks&#259;lik</i>, we were at
first led to conjecture that they procured their pots, or the
material for making them, in that neighbourhood; this, however,
they assured us was not the case, the whole of them coming from
Akkoolee, where the stone is found in very high situations.&nbsp;
One of the women at Winter Island, who came from that country,
said that her parents were much employed in making these pots,
chiefly it seems as articles of barter.&nbsp; The asbestos, which
they use in the shape of a roundish pointed stick called
<i>tatko</i> for <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>trimming the lamps, is met with
about Repulse Bay, and generally, as they said, on low land.</p>
<p>Besides the ootkooseeks, they have circular and oval vessels
of whalebone of various sizes, which, as well as their ivory
knives made out of a walrus&rsquo;s tusk, are precisely similar
to those described on the western coast of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay in
1820.&nbsp; They have also a number of smaller vessels of skin
sewed neatly together, and a large basket of the same material,
resembling a common sieve in shape, but with the bottom close and
tight, is to be seen in every apartment.&nbsp; Under every lamp
stands a sort of &ldquo;save-all,&rdquo; consisting of a small
skin basket for catching the oil that falls over.&nbsp; Almost
every family was in possession of a wooden tray very much
resembling those used to carry butcher&rsquo;s meat in England,
and of nearly the same dimensions, which we understood them to
have procured by way of Noowook.&nbsp; They had a number of the
bowls or cups already once or twice alluded to as being made out
of the thick root of the horn of the musk-ox.&nbsp; Of the
smaller part of the same horn they also form a convenient
drinking-cup, sometimes turning it up artificially about
one-third from the point, so as to be almost parallel to the
other part, and cutting it full of small notches as a convenience
in grasping it.&nbsp; These, or any other vessels for drinking,
they call <i>Imm&#333;&#333;chiuk</i>.</p>
<p>Besides the ivory knives, the men were well supplied with a
much more serviceable kind, made of iron, and called
<i>panna</i>.&nbsp; The form of this knife is very peculiar,
being seven inches long, two and a quarter broad, quite straight
and flat, pointed at the end, and ground equally sharp at both
edges; this is firmly secured into a handle of bone or wood,
about a foot long, by two or three iron rivets, and has all the
appearance of a most destructive <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>spear-head,
but is nevertheless put to no other purpose than that of a very
useful knife, which the men are scarcely ever without, especially
on their sealing excursions.&nbsp; For these, and several knives
of European form, they are probably indebted to an indirect
communication with our factories in Hudson&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; The
same may be observed of the best of their women&rsquo;s knives
(<i>ooloo</i>), on one of which, of a larger size than usual,
were the names of &ldquo;Wild and Sorby.&rdquo;&nbsp; When of
their own manufacture, the only iron part was a little narrow
slip let into the bone and secured by rivets.&nbsp; It is curious
to observe in this, and in numerous other instances, how exactly,
amidst all the diversity of time and place, these people have
preserved unaltered their manners and habits as mentioned by
Crantz.&nbsp; That which an absurd dread of innovation does in
China, the want of intercourse with other nations has effected
among the Esquimaux.</p>
<p>Of the horn of the musk-ox they make also very good spoons
much like ours in shape; and I must not omit to mention their
marrow spoons (<i>patt&#275;kniuk</i>, from
<i>p&#257;tt&#277;k</i>, marrow), made out of long, narrow,
hollowed pieces of bone, of which every housewife has a bunch of
half a dozen or more tied together, and generally attached to her
needle-case.</p>
<p>For the purpose of obtaining fire the Esquimaux use two lumps
of common iron pyrites, from which sparks are struck into a
little leathern case containing moss well dried and rubbed
between the hands.&nbsp; If this tinder does not readily catch, a
small quantity of the white floss of the seed of the ground
willow is laid above the moss.&nbsp; As soon as a spark has
caught, it is gently blown till the fire has spread an inch
around, when, the pointed end of a piece of oiled wick being
applied, it soon bursts into a <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>flame, the
whole process having occupied perhaps two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Among the articles in their possession, which must have been
obtained by communication along shore with Hudson&rsquo;s Bay,
were two large copper kettles, several open knives with crooked
wooden handles, and many fragments of copper, iron, and old
files.&nbsp; On a small European axe was observed the name of
&ldquo;Foster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In enumerating the articles of their food, we might perhaps
give a list of every animal inhabiting these regions, as they
certainly will at times eat any one of them.&nbsp; Their
principal dependence, however, is on the reindeer
(<i>t&#333;&#333;kto&#335;</i>), musk-ox
(<i>&#333;&#333;m&#301;ngm&#365;k</i>)(in the parts where this
animal is found), whale (<i>&#257;gg&#259;w&#277;k</i>), walrus
(<i>&#275;i-&#365;-&#277;k</i>), the large and small seal
(<i>&#333;g&#365;ke</i> and <i>n&#275;itiek</i>), and two sorts
of salmon, the <i>&#275;w&#277;e-t&#257;r&#335;ke</i> (<i>salmo
alpinus</i>?) and <i>ichl&#363;&#335;w&#335;ke</i>.&nbsp; The
latter is taken by hooks in freshwater lakes, and the former by
spearing in the shoal water of certain inlets of the sea.&nbsp;
Of all these animals they can only procure in the winter the
walrus and small seal upon this part of the coast; and these at
times, as we have seen, in scarcely sufficient quantity for their
subsistence.</p>
<p>They certainly in general prefer eating their meat cooked, and
while they have fuel they usually boil it; but this is a luxury
and not a necessary to them.&nbsp; Oily as the nature of their
principal food is, yet they commonly take an equal proportion of
lean to their fat, and unless very hungry do not eat it
otherwise.&nbsp; Oil they seldom or never use in any way as a
part of their general diet; and even our butter, of which they
were fond, they would not eat without a due quantity of
bread.&nbsp; They do not like salt meat as well as fresh, and
never use salt themselves; but ship&rsquo;s pork, or even a red
herring, did not come amiss <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>to
them.&nbsp; Of pea-soup they would eat as much as the sailors
could afford to give them; and that word was the only one, with
the exception of our names, which many of them ever learned in
English.&nbsp; Among their own luxuries must be mentioned a rich
soup called <i>k&#257;y&#335;</i>, made of blood, gravy, and
water, and eaten quite hot.&nbsp; In obtaining the names of
several plants, we learned that they sometimes eat the leaves of
sorrel (<i>k&#333;ng&#335;lek</i>), and those of the ground
willow; as also the red berries (<i>pa&#333;&#333;na-rootik</i>)
of the <i>vaccinium uliginosum</i>, and the root of the
<i>potentilla pulchella</i>; but these cannot be said to form a
part of their regular diet; scurvy grass they never eat.</p>
<p>Their only drink is water; and of this, when they can procure
it, they swallow an inconceivable quantity; so that one of the
principal occupations of the women during the winter is the
thawing of snow in the ootkooseks for this purpose.&nbsp; They
cut it into thin slices, and are careful to have it clean, on
which account they will bring it from a distance of fifty yards
from the huts.&nbsp; They have an extreme dislike to drinking
water much above the temperature of 32&deg;.&nbsp; In eating
their meals the mistress of the family, having previously cooked
the meat, takes a large lump out of the pot with her fingers, and
hands it to her husband, who placing a part of it between his
teeth cuts it off with a large knife in that position, and then
passes the knife and meat together to his next neighbour.&nbsp;
In cutting off a mouthful of meat the knife passes so close to
their lips, that nothing but constant habit could ensure them
from the danger of the most terrible gashes; and it would make an
English mother shudder to see the manner in which children, five
or six years old, are at all times freely trusted with a knife to
be used in this way.</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>The length of one of the best of seven canoes belonging
to these Esquimaux was twenty-five feet, including a
narrow-pointed projection, three feet long at each end, which
turns a little upward from the horizontal.&nbsp; The extreme
breadth, which is just before the circular hole, was twenty-one
inches, and the depth ten inches and a half.&nbsp; The plane of
the upper surface of the canoe, except in the two extreme
projections, bends downwards a little from the centre towards the
head and stern, giving it the appearance of what is in ships
called &ldquo;broken-backed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gunwales are of
fir, in some instances of one piece, three or four inches broad
in the centre and tapering gradually away towards the ends.&nbsp;
The timbers, as well as the fore-and-aft connecting pieces, are
of the same material, the former being an inch square, and
sometimes so close together as to require between forty and fifty
of them in one canoe: which when thus &ldquo;in frame&rdquo; is
one of the prettiest things of the kind that can be
imagined.&nbsp; The skin with which the canoe is covered is
exclusively that of the <i>neitiek</i>, prepared by scraping off
the hair and fat with an <i>ooloo</i>, and stretching it tight on
a frame over the fire; after which and a good deal of chewing, it
is sewn on by the women with admirable neatness and
strength.&nbsp; Their paddles have a blade at each end, the whole
length being nine feet and a half; the blades are covered with a
narrow plate of bone round the ends to secure them from
splitting: they are always made of fir, and generally of several
pieces scarfed and woolded together.</p>
<p>In summer they rest their canoes upon two small stones raised
four feet from the ground; and in winter, on a similar structure
of snow; in one case to allow them to dry freely, and in the
other to prevent the snow-drift <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>from
covering, and the dogs from eating them.&nbsp; The difficulty of
procuring a canoe may be concluded from the circumstance of there
being at Winter Island twenty men able to manage one, and only
seven canoes among them.&nbsp; Of these indeed only three or four
were in good repair, the rest being wholly or in part stripped of
the skin, of which a good deal was occasionally cut off during
the winter, to make boots, shoes, and mittens for our
people.&nbsp; We found no <i>oomiak</i>, or women&rsquo;s boat,
among them, and understood that they were not in the habit of
using them, which may in part be accounted for by their passing
so much of the summer in the interior; they knew very well,
however, what they were, and made some clumsy models of them for
our people.</p>
<p>In the weapons used for killing their game there is
considerable variety, according to the animal of which they are
in pursuit.&nbsp; The most simple of these is the
<i>&#333;&#333;n&#259;k</i>, which they use only for killing the
small seal.&nbsp; It consists of a light staff of wood, four feet
in length, having at one end the point of a narwhal&rsquo;s horn,
from ten to eighteen inches long, firmly secured by rivets and
wooldings; at the other end is a smaller and less effective point
of the same kind.&nbsp; To prevent losing the ivory part in case
of the wood breaking, a stout thong runs along the whole length
of the wood, each end passing through a hole in the ivory, and
the bight secured in several places to the staff.&nbsp; In this
weapon, as far as it has yet been described, there is little art
or ingenuity displayed; but a considerable degree of both in an
appendage called <i>si&#257;tk&#335;</i>, consisting of a piece
of bone three inches long, and having a point of iron at one end,
and at the other end a small hole or socket to receive the point
of the oonak.&nbsp; Through the middle of this instrument is
secured <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>the <i>&#257;llek</i>, or line of
thong, of which every man has, when sealing, a couple of coils,
each from four to six fathoms long, hanging at his back.&nbsp;
These are made of the skin of the <i>oguke</i> as in Greenland,
and are admirably adapted to the purpose, both on account of
their strength, and the property which they possess of preserving
their pliability even in the most intense frost.</p>
<p>When a seal is seen, the siatko is taken from a little
leathern case, in which, when out of use, it is carefully
enclosed, and attached by its socket to the point of the spear;
in this situation it is retained by bringing the allek tight down
and fastening it round the middle of the staff by what seamen
call a &ldquo;slippery hitch,&rdquo; which may instantly be
disengaged by pulling on the other end of the line.&nbsp; As soon
as the spear has been thrown, and the animal struck, the siatko
is thus purposely separated; and being slung by the middle, now
performs very effectually the important office of a barb, by
turning at right angles to the direction in which it has entered
the orifice.&nbsp; This device is in its principle superior even
to our barb; for the instant any strain is put upon the line it
acts like a toggle, opposing its length to a wound only as wide
as its own breadth.</p>
<p>The <i>&#257;kl&#277;ak</i>, or <i>akl&#275;&#275;g&#259;</i>,
used for the large seal, has a blown bladder attached to the
staff, for the purpose of impeding the animal in the water.&nbsp;
The weapon with two long parallel prongs of bone or iron,
obtained from the natives of the Savage Islands, these people
also called <i>akleak</i>, and said it was for killing seals.</p>
<p>The third and largest weapon is that called <i>katteelik</i>,
with which the walrus and whale are attacked.&nbsp; The staff of
this is not longer but much stouter than that of the others,
especially towards the middle, where there is <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>a small
shoulder of ivory securely lashed to it for the thumb to rest
against, and thus to give additional force in throwing or
thrusting the spear.&nbsp; The ivory point of this weapon is made
to fit into a socket at the end of the staff, where it is secured
by double thongs, in such a manner as steadily to retain its
position when a strain is put upon it in the direction of its
length, but immediately disengaging itself with a sort of spring,
when any lateral strain endangers its breaking.&nbsp; The siatko
is always used with this spear; and to the end of the allek, when
the animal pursued is in open water, they attach a whole
seal-skin (<i>h&#335;w-w&#363;t-t&#259;</i>), inflated like a
bladder, for the purpose of tiring it out in its progress through
the water.</p>
<p>They have a spear called <i>&#299;ppoo</i> for killing deer in
the water.&nbsp; They described it as having a light staff and a
small head of iron, but they had none of these so fitted in the
winter.&nbsp; The <i>n&#363;g&#365;ee</i>, or dart for birds,
has, besides its two ivory prongs at the end of the staff, three
divergent ones in the middle of it, with several small double
barbs upon them turning inwards; they differ from the
<i>nuguit</i> of Greenland, and that of the Savage Islands, in
having these prongs always of unequal lengths.&nbsp; To give
additional velocity to the bird-dart, they use a throwing-stick
(<i>noke-shak</i>) which is probably the same as the
&ldquo;hand-board&rdquo; figured by Crantz.&nbsp; It consists of
a flat board about eighteen inches in length, having a groove to
receive the staff, two others and a hole for the fingers and
thumb, and a small spike fitted for a hole in the end of the
staff.&nbsp; This instrument is used for the bird-dart
only.&nbsp; The spear for salmon or other fish, called
k&#257;k&#277;e-w&#277;i, consists of a wooden staff with a spike
of bone or ivory, three inches long, secured at one end.&nbsp; On
each <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>side of the spike is a curved prong,
much like that of a pitchfork, but made of flexible horn, which
gives them a spring, and having a barb on the inner part of the
point turning downwards.&nbsp; Their fish-hooks
(<i>kakli&#333;kia</i>) consist only of a nail crooked and
pointed at one end, the other being let into a piece of ivory to
which the line is attached.&nbsp; A piece of deer&rsquo;s horn or
curved bone, only a foot long, is used as a rod, and completes
this very rude part of their fishing-gear.</p>
<p>Of their mode of killing seals in the winter I have already
spoken in the course of the foregoing narrative, as far as we
were enabled to make ourselves acquainted with it.&nbsp; In their
summer exploits on the water, the killing of the whale is the
most arduous undertaking which they have to perform; and one
cannot sufficiently admire the courage and activity which, with
gear apparently so inadequate, it must require to accomplish this
business.&nbsp; Okotook, who was at the killing of two whales in
the course of a single summer, and who described the whole of it
quite <i>con amore</i>, mentioned the names of thirteen men who,
each in his canoe, had assisted on one of these occasions.&nbsp;
When a fish is seen lying on the water, they cautiously paddle up
astern of him, till a single canoe, preceding the rest, comes
close to him on one quarter, so as to enable the man to drive the
<i>katteelik</i> into the animal with all the force of both
arms.&nbsp; This having the <i>siatko</i>, a long <i>allek</i>,
and the inflated seal-skin attached to it, the whale immediately
dives, taking the whole apparatus with him except the
<i>katteelik</i> which, being disengaged in the manner before
described, floats to the surface and is picked up by its
owner.&nbsp; The animal re-appearing after some time, all the
canoes again paddle towards him, some warning being <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>given by the seal-skin buoy floating on the
surface.&nbsp; Each man being furnished like the first, they
repeat the blows as often as they find opportunity, till perhaps
every line has been thus employed.&nbsp; After pursuing him in
this manner, sometimes for half a day, he is at length so wearied
by the resistance of the buoys, and exhausted by loss of blood,
as to be obliged to rise more and more often to the surface,
when, by frequent wounds with their spears, they succeed in
killing him, and tow their prize in triumph to the shore.&nbsp;
It is probable that with the whale, as with the smaller
sea-animals, some privilege or perquisite is given to the first
striker; and, like our own fishermen, they take a pride in having
it known that their spear has been the first to inflict a
wound.&nbsp; They meet with the most whales on the coast of
<i>Einw&#299;llik</i>.</p>
<p>In attacking the walrus in the water they use the same gear,
but with much more caution than with the whale, always throwing
the <i>katteelik</i> from some distance, lest the animal should
attack the canoe and demolish it with his tusks.&nbsp; The walrus
is in fact the only animal with which they use any caution of
this kind.&nbsp; They like the flesh better than that of the
seal; but venison is preferred by them to either of these, and
indeed to any other kind of meat.</p>
<p>At Winter Island they carefully preserved the heads of all the
animals killed during the winter, except two or three of the
walrus, which we obtained with great difficulty.&nbsp; There is
probably some superstition attached to this, but they told us
that they were to be thrown into the sea in the summer, which a
Greenlander studiously avoids doing; and, indeed, at Igloolik,
they had no objection to part with them before the summer
arrived.&nbsp; As the blood of the animals which they kill is all
used as <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>food of the most luxurious kind,
they are careful to avoid losing any portion of it; for this
purpose they carry with them on their excursions a little
instrument of ivory called <i>t&#335;op&#333;&#333;t&#259;</i>,
in form and size exactly resembling a &ldquo;twenty-penny&rdquo;
nail, with which they stop up the orifice made by the spear, by
thrusting it through the skin by the sides of the wound, and
securing it with a twist.&nbsp; I must here also mention a simple
little instrument called <i>keipk&#363;ttuk</i>, being a slender
rod of bone nicely rounded, and having a point at one end and a
knob or else a laniard at the other.&nbsp; The use of this is to
thrust through the ice where they have reason to believe a seal
is at work underneath.&nbsp; This little instrument is sometimes
made as delicate as a fine wire, that the seal may not see it;
and a part still remaining above the surface informs the
fishermen by its motion whether the animal is employed in making
his hole: if not, it remains undisturbed, and the attempt is
given up in that place.</p>
<p>One of the best of their bows was made of a single piece of
fir, four feet eight inches in length, flat on the inner side and
rounded on the outer, being five inches in girth about the
middle, where, however, it is strengthened on the concave side,
when strung, by a piece of bone ten inches long, firmly secured
by tree-nails of the same material.&nbsp; At each end of the bow
is a knob of bone, or sometimes of wood covered with leather,
with a deep notch for the reception of the string.&nbsp; The only
wood which they can procure not possessing sufficient elasticity
combined with strength, they ingeniously remedy the defect by
securing to the back of the bow, and to the knobs at each end, a
quantity of small lines, each composed of a plait or
&ldquo;sinnet&rdquo; of three sinews.&nbsp; The number of lines
thus reaching from end to end is generally about <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>thirty; but besides these, several others are fastened
with hitches round the bow, in pairs, commencing eight inches
from one end, and again united at the same distance from the
other, making the whole number of strings, in the middle of the
bow sometimes amount to sixty.&nbsp; These being put on with the
bow somewhat bent the contrary way, produce a spring so strong as
to require considerable force as well as knack in stringing it
and giving the requisite velocity to the arrow.&nbsp; The bow is
completed by a woolding round the middle and a wedge or two, here
and there, driven in to tighten it.&nbsp; A bow in one piece is,
however, very rare; they generally consist of from two to five
pieces of bone of unequal lengths, secured together by rivets and
tree-nails.</p>
<p>The arrows vary in length from twenty to thirty inches,
according to the materials that can be commanded.&nbsp; About
two-thirds of the whole length is of fir rounded, and the rest of
bone let by a socket into the wood, and having a head of thin
iron, or more commonly of slate, secured into a slit by two
tree-nails.&nbsp; Towards the opposite end of the arrow are two
feathers, generally of the spotted oval, not very neatly lashed
on.&nbsp; The bow-string consists of from twelve to eighteen
small lines of three-sinew sinnet, having a loose twist, and with
a separate becket of the same size for going over the knobs at
the end of the bow.</p>
<p>We tried their skill in archery by getting them to shoot at a
mark for a prize, though with bows in extremely bad order, on
account of the frost, and their hands very cold.&nbsp; The mark
was two of their spears stuck upright in the snow, their breadth
being three inches and a half.&nbsp; At twenty yards they struck
this every time; at thirty, sent the arrows always within an inch
or two of it; and at forty or fifty yards, I should think, would
generally hit <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>a fawn if the animal stood
still.&nbsp; These weapons are perhaps sufficient to inflict a
mortal wound at something more than that distance, for which,
however, a strong arm would be required.&nbsp; The animals which
they kill with the bow and arrow for their subsistence are
principally the musk-ox and deer, and less frequently the bear,
wolf, fox, hare, and some of the smaller animals.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that the musk-ox is very rarely found to
extend his migrations to the eastward of a line passing through
Repulse Bay, or about the meridian of 86&deg; west, while in a
northern direction we know that he travels as far as the
seventy-sixth degree of latitude.&nbsp; In Greenland this animal
is known only by vague and exaggerated report; on the western
coast of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay it has certainly been seen, though
very rarely, by the present inhabitants; and the eldest person
belonging to the Winter Island tribe had never seen one to the
eastward of Eiwillik, where, as well as at
Akk&#333;&#333;le&#277;, they are said to be numerous on the
banks of fresh-water lakes and streams.&nbsp; The few men who had
been present at the killing of one of these creatures seemed to
pride themselves very much upon it.&nbsp; Toolooak, who was about
seventeen years of age, had never seen either the musk-ox or the
<i>k&#257;ble&#277;-&#257;rioo</i>, a proof that the latter also
is not common in this corner of America.</p>
<p>The reindeer are killed by the Esquimaux in great abundance in
the summer season, partly by driving them from islands or narrow
necks of land into the sea, and then spearing them from their
canoes; and partly by shooting them from behind heaps of stones
raised for the purpose of watching them and imitating their
peculiar bellow or grunt.&nbsp; Among the various artifices which
they employ for this purpose, one of the most ingenious <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>consists in two men walking directly from the deer they
wish to kill, when the animal almost always follows them.&nbsp;
As soon as they arrive at a large stone, one of the men hides
behind it with his bow, while the other, continuing to walk on,
soon leads the deer within range of his companion&rsquo;s
arrows.&nbsp; They are also very careful to keep to leeward of
the deer, and will scarcely go out after them at all when the
weather is calm.&nbsp; For several weeks in the course of the
summer some of these people almost entirely give up their fishery
on the coast, retiring to the banks of lakes several miles in the
interior, which they represent as large and deep and abounding
with salmon, while the pasture near them affords good feeding to
numerous herds of deer.</p>
<p>The distance to which these people extend their inland
migrations, and the extent of coast of which they possess a
personal knowledge, are really very considerable.&nbsp; Of these
we could at the time of our first intercourse form no correct
judgment, from our uncertainty as to the length of what they call
a <i>seenik</i> (sleep), or one day&rsquo;s journey, by which
alone they could describe to us, with the help of their imperfect
arithmetic, the distance from one place to another.&nbsp; But our
subsequent knowledge of the coast has cleared up much of this
difficulty, affording the means of applying to their
hydrographical sketches a tolerably accurate scale for those
parts which we have not hitherto visited.&nbsp; A great number of
these people, who were born at Amitioke and Igloolik, had been to
<i>Noowook</i>, or nearly as far south as Chesterfield Inlet,
which is about the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of their united knowledge
in a southerly direction.&nbsp; Not one of them had been by water
round to Akkoolee, but several by land; in which mode of
travelling they only consider that country <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>from three
to five days&rsquo; journey from Repulse Bay.&nbsp; Okotook and a
few others of the Winter Island tribe had extended their
peregrinations a considerable distance to the northward, over the
large insular piece of land to which we have applied the name of
Cockburn Island; which they described as high land and the resort
of numerous reindeer.&nbsp; Here Okotook informed us he had seen
icebergs, which these people call by a name
(<i>p&#299;cc&#259;l&#333;&#333;y&#259;k</i>) having in its
pronunciation some affinity to that used in Greenland.&nbsp; By
the information afterwards obtained when nearer the spot, we had
reason to suppose this land must reach beyond the seventy-second
degree of latitude in a northerly direction; so that these people
possess a personal knowledge of the continent of America and its
adjacent islands, from that parallel to Chesterfield Inlet in
63&frac34;&deg;, being a distance of more than five hundred miles
reckoned in a direct line, besides the numerous turnings and
windings of the coast along which they are accustomed to
travel.&nbsp; Ewerat and some others had been a considerable
distance up the Wager River; but no record had been preserved
among them of Captain Middleton&rsquo;s visit to that inlet about
the middle of the last century.</p>
<p>Of the continental shore to the westward of Akkoolee, the
Esquimaux invariably disclaimed the slightest personal knowledge;
for no land can be seen in that direction from the hills.&nbsp;
They entertain, however, a confused idea that neither Esquimaux
nor Indians could there subsist, for want of food.&nbsp; Of the
Indians they know enough by tradition to hold them in
considerable dread, on account of their cruel and ferocious
manners.&nbsp; When, on one occasion, we related the
circumstances of the inhuman massacre described by Hearne, they
crowded <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>round us in the hut, listening with
mute and almost breathless attention; and the mothers drew their
children closer to them, as if to guard them from the dreadful
catastrophe.&nbsp; It is worthy of notice that they call the
Indians by a name (<i>E&#275;rt-k&#277;i-l&#277;e</i>), which
appears evidently the same as that applied by the Greenlanders to
the man-eaters supposed to inhabit the eastern coast of their
country, and to whom terror has assigned a face like that of a
dog.</p>
<p>The Esquimaux take some animals in traps, and by a very
ingenious contrivance of this kind they caught two wolves at
Winter Island.&nbsp; It consists of a small house built of ice,
at one end of which a door, made of the same plentiful material,
is fitted to slide up and down in a groove; to the upper part of
this a line is attached, and, passing over the roof, is let down
into the trap at the inner end, and there held by slipping an eye
in the end of it over a peg of ice left for the purpose.&nbsp;
Over the peg, however, is previously placed a loose grummet, to
which the bait is fastened, and a false roof placed over all to
hide the line.&nbsp; The moment the animal drags at the bait the
grummet slips off the peg, bringing with it the line that held up
the door, and this falling down closes the trap and secures
him.</p>
<p>A trap for birds is formed by building a house of snow just
large enough to contain one person, who closes himself up in
it.&nbsp; On the top is left a small aperture, through which the
man thrusts one of his hands to secure the bird the moment he
alights to take away a bait of meat laid beside it.&nbsp; It is
principally gulls that are taken thus; and the boys sometimes
amuse themselves in this manner.&nbsp; A trap in which they catch
foxes has been mentioned in another place.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>The sledges belonging to these Esquimaux were in
general large and heavily constructed, being more adapted to the
carriage of considerable burdens than to very quick
travelling.&nbsp; They varied in size, being from six and a half
to nine feet in length, and from eighteen inches to two feet in
breadth.&nbsp; Some of those at Igloolik were of larger
dimensions, one being eleven feet in length, and weighing two
hundred and sixty-eight pounds, and two or three others above two
hundred pounds.&nbsp; The runners are sometimes made of the right
and left jaw-bones of a whale; but more commonly of several
pieces of wood or bone scarfed and lashed together, the
interstices being filled, to make all smooth and firm, with moss
stuffed in tight, and then cemented by throwing water to freeze
upon it.&nbsp; The lower part of the runner is shod with a plate
of harder bone, coated with fresh-water ice to make it run
smoothly and to avoid wear and tear, both which purposes are thus
completely answered.&nbsp; This coating is performed with a
mixture of snow and fresh water about half an inch thick, rubbed
over it till it is quite smooth and hard upon the surface, and
this is usually done a few minutes before setting out on a
journey.&nbsp; When the ice is only in part worn off, it is
renewed by taking some water into the mouth, and spirting it over
the former coating.&nbsp; We noticed a sledge which was extremely
curious, on account of one of the runners and a part of the other
being constructed without the assistance of wood, iron, or bone
of any kind.&nbsp; For this purpose a number of seal-skins being
rolled up and disposed into the requisite shape, an outer coat of
the same kind was sewed tightly round them; this formed the upper
half of the runner, the lower part of which consisted entirely of
moss moulded while wet into the <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>proper
form, and being left to freeze, adhering firmly together and to
the skins.&nbsp; The usual shoeing of smooth ice beneath
completed the runner, which for more than six months out of
twelve, in this climate, was nearly as hard as any wood; and for
winter use no way inferior to those constructed of more durable
materials.&nbsp; The crosspieces which form the bottom of the
sledge are made of bone, wood, or anything they can muster.&nbsp;
Over these is generally laid a seal-skin as a flooring, and in
the summertime a pair of deer&rsquo;s horns are attached to the
sledge as a back, which in the winter are removed to enable them
when stopping to turn the sledge up, so as to prevent the dogs
running away with it.&nbsp; The whole is secured by lashings of
thong, giving it a degree of strength combined with flexibility
which perhaps no other mode of fastening could effect.</p>
<p>The dogs of the Esquimaux, of which these people possessed
above a hundred, have been so often described that there may seem
little left to add respecting their external appearance, habits,
and use.&nbsp; Our visits to Igloolik having, however, made us
acquainted with some not hitherto described, I shall here offer a
further account of these invaluable animals.&nbsp; In the form of
their bodies, their short pricked ears, thick furry coat, and
bushy tail, they so nearly resemble the wolf of these regions
that, when of a light or brindled colour, they may easily at a
little distance be mistaken for that animal.&nbsp; To an eye
accustomed to both, however, a difference is perceptible in the
wolf&rsquo;s always keeping his head down and his tail between
his legs in running, whereas the dogs almost always carry their
tails handsomely curled over the back.&nbsp; A difference less
distinguishable, when the animals are apart, is the superior size
and more muscular make of the <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>wild
animal, especially about the breast and legs.&nbsp; The wolf is
also, in general, full two inches taller than any Esquimaux dog
we have seen; but those met with in 1818, in the latitude of
76&deg;, appear to come nearest to it in that respect.&nbsp; The
tallest dog at Igloolik stood two feet one inch from the ground,
measured at the withers; the average height was about two inches
less than this.</p>
<p>The colour of the dogs varies from a white, through brindled,
to black-and-white, or almost entirely black.&nbsp; Some are also
of a reddish or ferruginous colour, and others have a
brownish-red tinge on their legs, the rest of their bodies being
of a darker colour, and these last were observed to be generally
the best dogs.&nbsp; Their hair in the winter is from three to
four inches long; but besides this, Nature furnishes them during
this rigorous season with a thick under-coating of close soft
wool, which they begin to cast in the spring.&nbsp; While thus
provided, they are able to withstand the most inclement weather
without suffering from the cold; and at whatever temperature the
atmosphere may be, they require nothing but a shelter from the
wind to make them comfortable, and even this they do not always
obtain.&nbsp; They are also wonderfully enabled to endure the
cold even on those parts of the body which are not thus
protected, for we have seen a young puppy sleeping, with its bare
paw laid on an ice-anchor, with the thermometer at -30&deg;,
which with one of our dogs would have produced immediate and
intense pain, if not subsequent mortification.&nbsp; They never
bark, but have a long melancholy howl like that of the wolf, and
this they will sometimes perform in concert for a minute or two
together.&nbsp; They are besides always snarling and fighting
among one another, by which several of them are generally
lame.&nbsp; When much <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>caressed and well fed, they become
quite familiar and domestic; but this mode of treatment does not
improve their qualities as animals of draught.&nbsp; Being
desirous of ascertaining whether these dogs are wolves in a state
of domestication, a question which we understood to have been the
subject of some speculation, Mr. Skeoch, at my request, made a
skeleton of each, when the number of all the vertebra was found
to be the same in both, and to correspond with the well-known
anatomy of the wolf.</p>
<p>When drawing a sledge, the dogs have a simple harness
(<i>annoo</i>) of deer or seal skin, going round the neck by one
bight, and another for each of the fore-legs, with a single thong
leading over the back and attached to the sledge as a
trace.&nbsp; Though they appear at first sight to be huddled
together without regard to regularity, there is, in fact,
considerable attention paid to their arrangement, particularly in
the selection of a dog of peculiar spirit and sagacity, who is
allowed, by a longer trace, to precede the rest as leader, and to
whom, in turning to the right or left, the driver usually
addresses himself.&nbsp; This choice is made without regard to
age or sex, and the rest of the dogs take precedency according to
their training or sagacity, the least effective being put nearest
the sledge.&nbsp; The leader is usually from eighteen to twenty
feet from the fore part of the sledge, and the hindmost dog about
half that distance, so that when ten or twelve are running
together, several are nearly abreast of each other.&nbsp; The
driver sits quite low on the fore part of the sledge, with his
feet overhanging the snow on one side, and having in his hand a
whip, of which the handle, made either of wood, bone, or
whalebone, is eighteen inches, and the lash more than as many
feet in length.&nbsp; The part of the thong next the handle is
plaited a little <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>way down to stiffen it and give it a
spring, on which much of its use depends; and that which composes
the lash is chewed by the women to make it flexible in frosty
weather.&nbsp; The men acquire from their youth considerable
expertness in the use of this whip, the lash of which is left to
trail along the ground by the side of the sledge, and with which
they can inflict a very severe blow on any dog at pleasure.&nbsp;
Though the dogs are kept in training entirely by fear of the
whip, and indeed without it would soon have their own way, its
immediate effect is always detrimental to the draught of the
sledge; for not only does the individual that is struck draw back
and slacken his trace, but generally turns upon his next
neighbour, and this, passing on to the next, occasions a general
divergency, accompanied by the usual yelping and showing of
teeth.&nbsp; The dogs then come together again by degrees, and
the draught of the sledge is accelerated; but, even at the best
of times, by this rude mode of draught, the traces of one-third
of the dogs form an angle of thirty or forty degrees on each side
of the direction in which the sledge is advancing.&nbsp; Another
great inconvenience attending the Esquimaux method of putting the
dogs to, besides that of not employing their strength to the best
advantage, is the constant entanglement of the traces by the dogs
repeatedly doubling under from side to side to avoid the whip, so
that, after running a few miles, the traces always require to be
taken off and cleared.</p>
<p>In directing the sledge the whip acts no very essential part,
the driver for this purpose using certain words, as the carters
do with us, to make the dogs turn more to the right or
left.&nbsp; To these a good leader attends with admirable
precision, especially if his own name be <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>repeated at
the same time, looking behind over his shoulder with great
earnestness, as if listening to the directions of the
driver.&nbsp; On a beaten track, or even where a single foot or
sledge mark is occasionally discernible, there is not the
slightest trouble in guiding the dogs; for even in the darkest
night and in the heaviest snowdrift there is little or no danger
of their losing the road, the leader keeping his nose near the
ground, and directing the rest with wonderful sagacity.&nbsp;
Where, however, there is no beaten track, the best driver among
them makes a terribly circuitous course, as all the Esquimaux
roads plainly show; these generally occupying an extent of six
miles, when with a horse and sledge the journey would scarcely
have amounted to five.&nbsp; On rough ground, as among hummocks
of ice, the sledge would be frequently overturned, or altogether
stopped, if the driver did not repeatedly get off, and, by
lifting or drawing it to one side, steer it clear of those
accidents.&nbsp; At all times, indeed, except on a smooth and
well-made road, he is pretty constantly employed thus with his
feet, which, together with his never-ceasing vociferations and
frequent use of the whip, renders the driving of one of these
vehicles by no means a pleasant or easy task.&nbsp; When the
driver wishes to stop the sledge, he calls out &ldquo;Wo,
woa,&rdquo; exactly as our carters do; but the attention paid to
this command depends altogether on his ability to enforce
it.&nbsp; If the weight is small and the journey homeward, the
dogs are not to be thus delayed; the driver is therefore obliged
to dig his heels into the snow to obstruct their progress; and
having thus succeeded in stopping them, he stands up with one leg
before the foremost cross-piece of the sledge, till, by means of
laying the whip gently over each dog&rsquo;s head, he has <!--
page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>made them all lie down.&nbsp; He then takes care not to
quit his position; so that should the dogs set off he is thrown
upon the sledge, instead of being left behind by them.</p>
<p>With heavy loads the dogs draw best with one of their own
people, especially a woman, walking a little way ahead; and in
this case they are sometimes enticed to mend their pace by
holding a mitten to the mouth, and then making the motion of
cutting it with a knife, and throwing it on the snow, when the
dogs, mistaking it for meat, hasten forward to pick it up.&nbsp;
The women also entice them from the huts in a similar
manner.&nbsp; The rate at which they travel depends, of course,
on the weight they have to draw, and the road on which their
journey is performed.&nbsp; When the latter is level and very
hard and smooth, constituting what in other parts of North
America is called &ldquo;good sleighing,&rdquo; six or seven dogs
will draw from eight to ten hundredweight, at the rate of seven
or eight miles an hour, for several hours together, and will
easily under those circumstances perform a journey of fifty or
sixty miles a day; on untrodden snow, five-and-twenty or thirty
miles would be a good day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The same number
of well-fed dogs, with a weight of only five or six hundred
pounds (that of the sledge included), are almost unmanageable,
and will on a smooth road run any way they please at the rate of
ten miles an hour.&nbsp; The work performed by a greater number
of dogs is, however, by no means in proportion to this, owing to
the imperfect mode already described of employing the strength of
these sturdy creatures, and to the more frequent snarling and
fighting occasioned by an increase of numbers.</p>
<p>In the summer, when the absence of snow precludes the use of
sledges, the dogs are still made useful on <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>journeys
and hunting excursions, by being employed to carry burdens in a
kind of saddle-bags laid across their shoulders.&nbsp; A stout
dog thus accoutred will accompany his master, laden with a weight
of about twenty to twenty-five pounds.&nbsp; When leading the
dogs, the Esquimaux take a half hitch with the trace round their
necks to prevent their pulling, and the same plan is followed
when a sledge is left without a keeper.&nbsp; They are also in
the habit of tethering them, when from home, by tying up one of
the fore-legs; but a still more effectual method is similar to
that which we saw employed by the Greenlanders of Prince
Regent&rsquo;s Bay, and consists in digging with their spears two
holes in the ice in an oblique direction and meeting each other,
so as to leave an eye-bolt, to which the dogs are fastened.</p>
<p>The scent of the Esquimaux dogs is excellent; and this
property is turned to account by their masters in finding the
seal holes, which these invaluable animals will discover entirely
by the smell at a very great distance.&nbsp; The track of a
single deer upon the snow will in like manner set them off at a
full gallop, when travelling, at least a quarter of a mile before
they arrive at it, when they are with difficulty made to turn in
any other direction; and the Esquimaux are accustomed to set them
after those animals to hunt them down when already wounded with
an arrow.&nbsp; In killing bears the dogs act a very essential
part, and two or three of them when led on by a man will eagerly
attack one of those ferocious creatures.&nbsp; An Esquimaux
seldom uses any other weapon than his spear and <i>panna</i> in
this encounter, for which the readiness of the dogs may be
implied from the circumstance of the word &ldquo;nennook&rdquo;
(bear), being often used to encourage them when running in a
sledge.&nbsp; Indeed, the only animal <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>which they
are not eager to chase is the wolf, of which the greater part of
them seem to have an instinctive dread, giving notice at night of
their approach to the huts by a loud and continued howl.&nbsp;
There is not one dog in twenty among them that will voluntarily,
or indeed without a great deal of beating, take the water if they
think it is out of their depth, and the few that would do so were
spoken of as extraordinary exceptions.</p>
<p>The Esquimaux in general treat their dogs much as an unfeeling
master does his slaves; that is, they take just as much care of
them as their own interest is supposed to require.&nbsp; The
bitches with young are in the winter allowed to occupy a part of
their own beds, where they are carefully attended and fed by the
women, who will even supply the young ones with meat and water
from their mouths as they do their own children, and not
unfrequently also carry them in their hoods to take care of
them.&nbsp; It is probably on this account that the dogs are
always so much attached to the women, who can at any time catch
them or entice them from the huts when the men fail.&nbsp; Two
females that were with young on board the <i>Fury</i> in the
month of February brought forth six and seven at a litter, and
the former number were all females.&nbsp; Their feeding, which,
both in summer and winter, principally consists of
<i>k&#257;&#335;w</i>, or the skin and part of the blubber of the
walrus, is during the latter season very precarious, their
masters having then but little to spare.&nbsp; They therefore
become extremely thin at that time of the year, and would
scarcely be recognised as the same animals as when regularly fed
in the summer.&nbsp; No wonder therefore that they will eat
almost anything however tough or filthy, and that neither
whipping nor shouting will prevent their turning out of the road,
even <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>when going at full speed, to pick up
whatever they espy.&nbsp; When at the huts they are constantly
creeping in to pilfer what they can, and half the time of the
people sitting there is occupied in vociferating their names and
driving them by most unmerciful blows out of the
apartments.&nbsp; The dogs have no water to drink during the
winter, but lick up some clean snow occasionally as a substitute;
nor indeed if water be offered them do they care about it unless
it happens to be oily.&nbsp; They take great pleasure in rolling
in clean snow, especially after or during a journey, or when they
have been confined in a house during the night.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the rough treatment which they receive from their
masters their attachment to them is very great, and this they
display after a short absence by jumping up and licking their
faces all over with extreme delight.&nbsp; The Esquimaux,
however, never caress them, and indeed scarcely ever take any
notice of them but when they offend, and they are not then
sparing in their blows.&nbsp; The dogs have all names, to which
they attend with readiness, whether drawing in a sledge or
otherwise.&nbsp; Their names are frequently the same as those of
the people, and in some instances are given after the relations
of their masters, which seems to be considered an act of kindness
among them.&nbsp; Upon the whole, notwithstanding the services
performed by these valuable creatures, I am of opinion that art
cannot well have done less towards making them useful, and that
the same means in almost any other hands would be employed to
greater advantage.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>In the disposition of these people, there was of course among
so many individuals considerable variety as to <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>the minute
points; but in the general features of their character, which
with them are not subject to the changes produced by foreign
intercourse, one description will nearly apply to all.&nbsp; The
virtue which, as respected ourselves, we could most have wished
them to possess is honesty, and the impression derived from the
early part of our intercourse was certainly in this respect a
favourable one.&nbsp; A great many instances occurred, some of
which have been related, where they appeared even scrupulous in
returning articles that did not belong to them; and this too when
detection of a theft, or at least of the offender, would have
been next to impossible.&nbsp; As they grew more familiar with
us, and the temptations became stronger, they gradually relaxed
in their honesty, and petty thefts were from time to time
committed by several individuals both male and female among
them.</p>
<p>The bustle which any search for stolen goods occasioned at the
huts was a sufficient proof of their understanding the estimation
in which the crime was held by us.&nbsp; Until the affair was
cleared up they would affect great readiness to show every
article which they had got from the ships, repeating the name of
the donor with great warmth, as if offended at our suspicions,
yet with a half-smile on their countenances at our supposed
credulity in believing them.&nbsp; There was, indeed, at all
times some degree of trick and cunning in this show of openness
and candour; and they would at times bring back some very
trifling article that had been given them, tendering it as a sort
of expiation for the theft of another much more valuable.&nbsp;
When a search was making they would invent all sorts of lies to
screen themselves, not caring on whom besides the imputation
fell; and more than once they directed our people to the
apartments of others who were innocent of the <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>offence in
question.&nbsp; If they really knew the offender, they were
generally ready enough to inform against him, and this with an
air of affected secrecy and mysterious importance; and, as if the
dishonesty of another constituted a virtue in themselves, they
would repeat this information frequently, perhaps for a month
afterwards, setting up their neighbour&rsquo;s offence as a foil
to their own pretended honesty.</p>
<p>In appreciating the character of these people for honesty,
however, we must not fail to make due allowance for the degree of
temptation to which they were daily exposed amidst the boundless
stores of wealth which our ships appeared to them to
furnish.&nbsp; To draw a parallel case, we must suppose a
European of the lower class suffered to roam about amidst hoards
of gold and silver; for nothing less valuable can be justly
compared with the wood and iron that everywhere presented
themselves to their view on board the ships.&nbsp; The European
and the Esquimaux who, in cases so similar, both resist the
temptation of stealing, must be considered pretty nearly on a par
in the scale of honesty; and judging in this manner, the balance
might possibly be found in favour of the latter when compared
with any similar number of Europeans taken at random from the
lower class.</p>
<p>In what has been hitherto said, regard has been had only to
their dealings with us.&nbsp; In their transactions among
themselves there is no doubt that, except in one or two
privileged cases, such as that of destitute widows, the strictest
honesty prevails, and that as regards the good of their own
community they are generally honest people.&nbsp; We have in
numberless instances sent presents by one to another, and
invariably found that they had <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>been
faithfully delivered.&nbsp; The manner in which their various
implements are frequently left outside their huts is a proof,
indeed, that robbery is scarcely known among them.&nbsp; It is
true that there is not an article in the possession of one of
them of which any of the rest will not readily name the owner,
and the detection of a theft would therefore be certain and
immediate.&nbsp; Certainty of detection, however, among a lawless
and ferocious people, instead of preventing robbery, would more
probably add violence and murder to the first crime, and the
strongest would ultimately gain the upper hand.&nbsp; We cannot,
therefore, but admire the undisturbed security in which these
people hold their property without having recourse to any
restraint beyond that which is incurred by the tacitly received
law of mutual forbearance.</p>
<p>In the barter of their various commodities their dealings with
us were fair and upright, though latterly they were by no means
backward or inexpert in driving a bargain.&nbsp; The absurd and
childish exchanges which they at first made with our people
induced them subsequently to complain that the Kabloonas had
stolen their things, though the profit had been eventually a
hundredfold in their favour.&nbsp; Many such complaints were made
when the only fault in the purchaser had been excessive
liberality, and frequently also as a retort by way of warding off
the imputation of some dishonesty of their own.&nbsp; A trick not
uncommon with the women was to endeavour to excite the
commiseration and to tax the bounty of one person by relating
some cruel theft of this kind that had, as they said, been
practised upon them by another.&nbsp; One day, after I had bought
a knife of Togolat, she told Captain Lyon, in a most piteous
tone, that <i>Parree</i> had stolen her last <i>ooloo</i>, that
she did not know what to do <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>without
one, and, at length coming to the point, begged him to give her
one.&nbsp; Presently after this, her husband coming in and asking
for something to eat, she handed him some meat accompanied by a
very fine ooloo.&nbsp; Her son, being thus reminded of eating,
made the same request, upon which a second knife was produced,
and immediately after, a third of the same kind for
herself.&nbsp; Captain Lyon, having amused himself in watching
these proceedings, which so well confirmed the truth of the
proverb that certain people ought to have good memories, now took
the knives, one by one, out of their hands, and holding them up
to Togolat, asked her if Parree had not stolen her last
ooloo.&nbsp; A hearty laugh all round was the only notice taken
by them of this direct detection of the deceit.</p>
<p>The confidence which they really placed in us was daily and
hourly evinced by their leaving their fishing gear stuck in the
snow all round the ships; and not a single instance occurred, to
my knowledge, of any theft committed on their property.&nbsp; The
licking of the articles received from us was not so common with
them as with Esquimaux in general, and this practice was latterly
almost entirely left off by them.</p>
<p>Among the unfavourable traits in their character must be
reckoned an extreme disposition to envy, which displayed itself
on various occasions during our intercourse with them.&nbsp; If
we had made any presents in one hut, the inmates of the next
would not fail to tell us of it, accompanying their remarks with
some satirical observation, too unequivocally expressed to be
mistaken, and generally by some stroke of irony directed against
the favoured person.&nbsp; If any individual with whom we had
been intimate happened to be implicated in a theft, the
circumstance <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>became a subject of satisfaction too
manifest to be repressed, and we were told of it with expressions
of the most triumphant exultation on every occasion.&nbsp; It was
indeed curious, though ridiculous, to observe that, even among
these simple people, and in this obscure corner of the globe,
that little gossip and scandal so commonly practised in small
societies among us were very frequently displayed.&nbsp; This was
especially the case with the women, of whom it was not uncommon
to see a group sitting in a hut for hours together, each relating
her quota of information, now and then mimicking the persons of
whom they spoke, and interlarding their stories with jokes
evidently at the expense of their absent neighbours, though to
their own infinite amusement.</p>
<p>In extenuation, however, of these faults, it must be allowed
that we were ourselves the exciting cause which called them into
action, and without which they would be comparatively of rare
occurrence among them.&nbsp; Like every other child of Adam, they
undoubtedly possess their share of the seeds of these human
frailties; but even in this respect they need not shrink from a
comparison with ourselves, for who among us can venture to assure
himself that if exposed to similar temptations he would not be
found wanting?</p>
<p>To another failing to which they are addicted the same excuse
will not so forcibly apply, as in this respect our acquaintance
with them naturally furnishes an opportunity for the practice of
a virtue, rather than for the development of its opposite
vice.&nbsp; I have already, in the course of the foregoing
narrative, hinted at the want of gratitude evinced by these
people in their transactions with us.&nbsp; Among themselves,
almost the only case in which this sentiment can have any field
for exertion is <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>in the conduct of children towards
their parents, and in this respect, as I shall presently have
occasion to notice, their gratitude is by no means
conspicuous.&nbsp; Anything like a free gift is very little, if
at all, known among them.&nbsp; If A gives B a part of his seal
to-day, the latter soon returns an equal quantity when he is the
successful fisherman.&nbsp; Uncertain as their mode of living is,
and dependent as they are upon each other&rsquo;s exertions, this
custom is the evident and unquestionable interest of all.&nbsp;
The regulation does credit to their wisdom, but has nothing to do
with their generosity.&nbsp; This being the case, it might be
supposed that our numerous presents, for which no return was
asked, would have excited in them something like thankfulness,
combined with admiration; but this was so little the case that
the <i>coyenna</i> (thanks) which did now and then escape them,
expressed much less than even the most common-place &ldquo;thank
ye&rdquo; of civilised society.&nbsp; Some exceptions, for they
were only exceptions, and rare ones, to this rule have been
mentioned as they occurred; but, in general, however considerable
the benefit conferred, it was forgotten in a day; and this
forgetfulness was not unfrequently aggravated by their giving out
that their benefactor had been so shabby as to make them no
present at all.&nbsp; Even those individuals who, either from
good behaviour or superior intelligence, had been most noticed by
us, and particularly such as had slept on board the ships, and
whether in health or sickness had received the most friendly
treatment from everybody, were in general just as indifferent as
the rest; and I do not believe that any one amongst them would
have gone half a mile out of his road, or have sacrificed the
most trivial self-gratification, to have served us.&nbsp; Though
the riches lay on our side, they possessed abundant means of
making some <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>nominal return, which, for the sake
of the principle that prompted it, would of course have been
gratifying to us.&nbsp; Okotook and Iligliuk, whom I had most
loaded with presents, and who had never offered me a single free
gift in return, put into my hand, at the time of their first
removal from Winter Island, a dirty crooked model of a spear, so
shabbily constructed that it had probably been already refused as
an article of barter by many of the ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;
On my accepting this, from an unwillingness to affront them, they
were uneasy and dissatisfied till I had given them something in
return, though their hands were full of the presents which I had
just made them.&nbsp; Selfishness is, in fact, almost without
exception their universal characteristic, and the main-spring of
all their actions, and that, too, of a kind the most direct and
unamiable that can well be imagined.</p>
<p>In the few opportunities we had of putting their hospitality
to the test, we had every reason to be pleased with them.&nbsp;
Both as to food and accommodation, the best they had were always
at our service; and their attention, both in kind and degree, was
everything that hospitality and even good breeding could
dictate.&nbsp; The kindly offices of drying and mending our
clothes, cooking our provision, and thawing snow for our drink
were performed by the women with an obliging cheerfulness which
we shall not easily forget, and which commanded its due share of
our admiration and esteem.&nbsp; While thus their guest, I have
passed an evening not only with comfort, but with extreme
gratification; for with the women working and singing, their
husbands quietly mending their lines, the children playing before
the door, and the pot boiling over the blaze of a cheerful lamp,
one might well forget for the time that an Esquimaux hut was the
scene of this <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>domestic comfort and tranquillity;
and I can safely affirm with Cartwright, that, while thus lodged
beneath their roof, I know no people whom I would more
confidently trust, as respects either my person or my property,
than the Esquimaux.&nbsp; It is painful, and may perhaps be
considered invidious after this, to inquire how far their
hospitality would in all probability be extended if interest were
wholly separated from its practice, and a stranger were destitute
and unlikely soon to repay them.&nbsp; But truth obliges me to
confess that, from the extreme selfishness of their general
conduct, as well as from their behaviour in some instances to the
destitute of their own tribe, I should be sorry to lie under the
necessity of thus drawing very largely on their bounty.</p>
<p>The estimation in which women are held among these people is,
I think, somewhat greater than is usual in savage life.&nbsp; In
their general employments they are by no means the drudges that
the wives of the Greenlanders are said to be; being occupied only
in those cares which may properly be called domestic, and as such
are considered the peculiar business of the women among the lower
classes in civilised society.&nbsp; The wife of one of these
people, for instance, makes and attends the fire, cooks the
victuals, looks after the children, and is sempstress to her
whole family; while her husband is labouring abroad for their
subsistence.&nbsp; In this respect it is not even necessary to
except their task of cutting up the small seals, which is, in
truth, one of the greatest luxuries and privileges they enjoy;
and even if it were esteemed a labour, it could scarcely be
considered equivalent to that of the women in many of our own
fishing-towns, where the men&rsquo;s business is at an end the
moment the boat touches the beach.&nbsp; The most laborious of
their tasks occurs <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>perhaps in making their various
journeys, when all their goods and chattels are to be removed at
once, and when each individual must undoubtedly perform a full
share of the general labour.&nbsp; The women are, however, good
walkers, and not easily fatigued; for we have several times known
a young woman of two-and-twenty, with a child in her hood, walk
twelve miles to the ships and back again the same day for the
sake of a little bread-dust and a tin canister.&nbsp; When
stationary in the winter, they have really almost a sinecure of
it, sitting quietly in their huts, and having little or no
employment for the greater part of the day.&nbsp; In short, there
are few, if any, people in this state of society among whom the
women are so well off.&nbsp; They always sit upon the beds with
their legs doubled under them, and are uneasy in the posture
usual with us.&nbsp; The men sometimes sit as we do, but more
generally with their legs crossed before them.</p>
<p>The women do not appear to be in general very prolific.&nbsp;
Illumea, indeed, had borne seven children, but no second instance
of an equal number in one family afterwards came to our
knowledge; three or four is about the usual number.&nbsp; They
are, according to their own account, in the habit of suckling
their children to the age of three years; but we have seen a
child of five occasionally at the breast, though they are
dismissed from the mother&rsquo;s hood at about the former
age.&nbsp; The time of weaning them must of course, in some
instances, depend on the mother&rsquo;s again becoming pregnant,
and if this succeeds quickly it must, as Crantz relates of the
Greenlanders, go hard with one of the infants.&nbsp; Nature,
however, seems to be kind to them in this respect, for we did not
witness one instance, nor hear of any, in which a woman was put
to this inconvenience and distress.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to
see one <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>woman suckling the child of another,
while the latter happens to be employed in her other domestic
occupations.&nbsp; They are in the habit also of feeding their
younger children from their own mouths, softening the food by
mastication, and then turning their heads round, so that the
infant in the hood may put its lips to theirs.&nbsp; The chill is
taken from water for them in the same manner, and some fathers
are very fond of taking their children on their knees and thus
feeding them.&nbsp; The women are more desirous of having sons
than daughters, as on the former must principally depend their
support in old age.</p>
<p>Twelve of the men had each two wives, and some of the younger
ones had also two betrothed; two instances occurred of the father
and son being married to sisters.&nbsp; The custom of betrothing
children in their infancy is commonly practised here, in which
respect these people differ from the natives of Greenland, where
it is comparatively rare.&nbsp; A daughter of Arnaneelia, between
two and three years old, had long been thus contracted to
Okotook&rsquo;s son, a hero of six or seven, and the latter used
to run about the hut, calling his intended by the familiar
appellation of <i>N&#335;&#335;ll&#275;-&#259;</i> (wife), to the
great amusement of the parents.&nbsp; When a man has two wives,
there is generally a difference of five or six years in their
ages.&nbsp; The senior takes her station next the principal fire,
which comes entirely under her management; and she is certainly
considered in some respects superior to the other, though they
usually live together in the utmost harmony.&nbsp; The men
sometimes repudiate their wives without ceremony, in case of real
or supposed bad behaviour, as in Greenland, but this does not
often occur.&nbsp; There was a considerable disparity of age
between many of the men and their wives, the husband being
sometimes the oldest <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>by twenty years or more, and this
also when he had never married any former wife.&nbsp; We knew no
instance in which the number of a man&rsquo;s wives exceeded two,
and indeed we had every reason to believe that the practice is
never admitted among them.&nbsp; We met with a singular instance
of two men having exchanged wives, in consequence merely of one
of the latter being pregnant at the time when her husband was
about to undertake a long journey.</p>
<p>The authority of the husband seems to be sufficiently
absolute, depending nevertheless in great measure on the
dispositions of the respective parties.&nbsp; Iligliuk was one of
those women who seemed formed to manage their husbands; and we
one day saw her take Okotook to task in a very masterly style for
having bartered away a good jacket for an old useless pistol
without powder or shot.&nbsp; He attempted at first to bluster in
his turn, and with most women would probably have gained his
point.&nbsp; But with Iligliuk this would not do; she saw at once
the absurdity of his bargain, and insisted on his immediately
cancelling it, which was accordingly done, and no more said about
it.&nbsp; In general, indeed, the husband maintains his
authority, and in several instances of supposed bad behaviour in
a wife, we saw obedience enforced in a pretty summary
manner.&nbsp; It is very rare, however, to see them proceed to
this extremity; and the utmost extent of a husband&rsquo;s want
of tenderness towards his wife consists in general in making her
walk or lead the dogs, while he takes his own seat in the sledge
and rides in comfort.&nbsp; Widows, as might be expected, are not
so well off as those whose husbands are living, and this
difference is especially apparent in their clothes, which are
usually very dirty, thin, and ragged; when indeed they happen to
have <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>no near relatives, their fate, as we
have already seen, is still worse than this.</p>
<p>I fear we cannot give a very favourable account of the
chastity of the women, nor of the delicacy of their husbands in
this respect.&nbsp; As for the latter, it was not uncommon for
them to offer their wives as freely for sale as a knife or a
jacket.&nbsp; Some of the young men informed us that, when two of
them were absent together on a sealing excursion, they often
exchanged wives for the time, as a matter of friendly
convenience; and indeed, without mentioning any other instances
of this nature, it may safely be affirmed that in no country is
prostitution carried to greater lengths than among these
people.&nbsp; The behaviour of most of the women when their
husbands were absent from the huts plainly evinced their
indifference towards them, and their utter disregard of connubial
fidelity.&nbsp; The departure of the men was usually the signal
for throwing aside restraint, which was invariably resumed on
their return.&nbsp; For this event they take care to be prepared
by the report of the children, one of whom is usually posted on
the outside for the purpose of giving due notice.</p>
<p>The affection of parents for their children was frequently
displayed by these people, not only in the mere passive
indulgence, and abstinence from corporal punishment, for which
Esquimaux have before been remarked, but by a thousand playful
endearments also, such as parents and nurses practise in our own
country.&nbsp; Nothing indeed can well exceed the kindness with
which they treat their children; and this trait in their
character deserves to be the more insisted on, because it is in
reality the only very amiable one which they possess.&nbsp; It
must be confessed, indeed, that the gentleness and docility of
<!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>the children are such as to occasion their parents
little trouble, and to render severity towards them quite
unnecessary.&nbsp; Even from their earliest infancy, they possess
that quiet disposition, gentleness of demeanour, and uncommon
evenness of temper, for which in more mature age they are for the
most part distinguished.&nbsp; Disobedience is scarcely ever
known, a word or even a look from a parent is enough; and I never
saw a single instance of that frowardness and disposition to
mischief which with our youth so often requires the whole
attention of a parent to watch over and to correct.&nbsp; They
never cry from trifling accidents, and sometimes not even from
very severe hurts, at which an English child would sob for an
hour.&nbsp; It is indeed astonishing to see the indifference with
which, even as tender infants, they bear the numerous blows they
accidentally receive when carried at their mothers&rsquo;
backs.</p>
<p>They are just as fond of play as any other young people, and
of the same kind; only that while an English child draws a cart
of wood, an Esquimaux of the same age has a sledge of whalebone;
and for the superb baby-house of the former, the latter builds a
miniature hut of snow, and begs a lighted wick from her
mother&rsquo;s lamp to illuminate the little dwelling.&nbsp;
Their parents make for them, as dolls, little figures of men and
women, habited in the true Esquimaux costume, as well as a
variety of other toys, many of them having some reference to
their future occupations in life, such as canoes, spears, and
bows and arrows.&nbsp; The drum or tambourine, mentioned by
Crantz, is common among them, and used not only by the children,
but by the grown-up people at some of their games.&nbsp; They
sometimes serrate the edges of two strips of whalebone and whirl
them round their heads, just as <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>boys do in
England to make the same peculiar humming sound.&nbsp; They will
dispose one piece of wood on another, as an axis, in such a
manner that the wind turns it round like the arms of a windmill;
and so of many other toys of the same simple kind.&nbsp; These
are the distinct property of the children, who will sometimes
sell them while their parents look on, without interfering or
expecting to be consulted.</p>
<p>When not more than eight years old the boys are taken by their
fathers on their sealing excursions, where they begin to learn
their future business; and even at that early age they are
occasionally intrusted to bring home a sledge and dogs from a
distance of several miles over the ice.&nbsp; At the age of
eleven we see a boy with his watertight boots and moccasins, a
spear in his hand, and a small coil of line at his back,
accompanying the men to the fishery, under every circumstance;
and from this time his services daily increase in value to the
whole tribe.&nbsp; On our first intercourse with them we supposed
that they would not unwillingly have parted with their children
in consideration of some valuable present, but in this we
afterwards found that we were much mistaken.&nbsp; Happening one
day to call myself Toolooak&rsquo;s <i>attata</i> (father), and
pretend that he was to remain with me on board the ship, I
received from the old man, his father, no other answer than what
seemed to be very strongly and even satirically implied, by his
taking one of our gentlemen by the arm and calling him his son;
thus intimating that the adoption which he proposed was as
feasible and as natural as my own.</p>
<p>The custom of adoption is carried to very great lengths among
these people, and served to explain to us several apparent
inconsistencies with respect to their relationships.&nbsp; <!--
page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>The adoption of a child in civilised countries has
usually for its motive either a tenderness for the object itself,
or some affection or pity for its deceased, helpless, or unknown
parents.&nbsp; Among the Esquimaux, however, with whom the two
first of these causes would prove but little excitement, and the
last can have no place, the custom owes its origin entirely to
the obvious advantage of thus providing for a man&rsquo;s own
subsistence in advanced life; and it is consequently confined
almost without exception to the adoption of sons, who can alone
contribute materially to the support of an aged and infirm
parent.&nbsp; When a man adopts the son of another as his own, he
is said to &ldquo;<i>tego</i>,&rdquo; or take him; and at
whatever age this is done (though it generally happens in
infancy), the child then lives with his new parents, calls them
father and mother, is sometimes even ignorant of any such
transfer having been made, especially if his real parents should
be dead; and whether he knows it or not, is not always willing to
acknowledge any but those with whom he lives.&nbsp; Without
imputing much to the natural affection of these people for their
offspring, which, like their other passions, is certainly not
remarkable for its strength, there would seem, on the score of
disinterestedness, a degree of consideration in a man&rsquo;s
thus giving his son to another, which is scarcely compatible with
the general selfishness of the Esquimaux character; but there is
reason to suppose that the expediency of this measure is
sometimes suggested by a deficiency of the mother&rsquo;s milk,
and not unfrequently perhaps by the premature death of the real
parent.&nbsp; The agreement seems to be always made between the
fathers, and to differ in no respect from the transfer of other
property, except that none can equal in value the property <!--
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>thus disposed of.&nbsp; The good sense, good fortune,
or extensive claims of some individuals were particularly
apparent in this way, from the number of sons they had
adopted.&nbsp; Toolemak, deriving perhaps some advantage from his
qualifications as Angetkook, had taken care to negotiate for the
adoption of some of the finest male children of the tribe; a
provision which now appeared the more necessary from his having
lost four children of his own, besides Noogloo, who was one of
his <i>tego&rsquo;d</i> sons.&nbsp; In one of the two instances
that came to our knowledge of the adoption of a female child,
both its own parents were still living, nor could we ascertain
the motive for this deviation from the more general custom.</p>
<p>In their behaviour to old people, whose age or infirmities
render them useless and therefore burdensome to the community,
the Esquimaux betray a degree of insensibility, bordering on
inhumanity, and ill-repaying the kindness of an indulgent
parent.&nbsp; The old man Hikkeiera, who was very ill during the
winter, used to lie day after day little regarded by his wife,
son, daughter, and other relatives, except that his wretched
state constituted, as they well knew, a forcible claim upon our
charity; and, with this view, it was sure to excite a whine of
sympathy and commiseration whenever we visited or spoke of
him.&nbsp; When, however, a journey of ten miles was to be
performed over the ice, they left him to find his way with a
stick in the best manner he could, while the young and robust
ones were many of them drawn on sledges.&nbsp; There is, indeed,
no doubt that, had their necessities or mode of life required a
longer journey than he could thus have accomplished, they would
have pushed on like the Indians and left a fellow-creature to
perish.&nbsp; It was certainly considered incumbent on his son to
support him, <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and he was fortunate in that
son&rsquo;s being a very good man; but a few more such journeys
to a man of seventy would not impose this incumbrance upon him
much longer.&nbsp; Illumea, the mother of several grown-up
children, lived also in the same apartment with her youngest son,
and in the same hut with her other relations.&nbsp; She did not,
however, interfere, as in Greenland, with the management of her
son&rsquo;s domestic concerns, though his wife was half an
idiot.&nbsp; She was always badly clothed, and even in the midst
of plenty not particularly well fed, receiving everything more as
an act of charity than otherwise; and she will probably be less
and less attended to in proportion as she stands more in need of
assistance.</p>
<p>The different families appear always to live on good terms
with each other, though each preserves its own habitation and
property as distinct and independent as any housekeeper in
England.&nbsp; The persons living under one roof, who are
generally closely related, maintain a degree of harmony among
themselves which is scarcely ever disturbed.&nbsp; The more
turbulent passions, which when unrestrained by religious
principle or unchecked by the dread of human punishment, usually
create so much havoc in the world, seem to be very seldom excited
in the breasts of these people, which renders personal violence
or immoderate anger extremely rare among them; and one may sit in
a hut for a whole day, and never witness an angry word or look,
except in driving out the dogs.&nbsp; If they take an offence, it
is more common for them to show it by the more quiet method of
sulkiness; and this they now and then tried as a matter of
experiment with us.&nbsp; Okotook, who was often in this humour,
once displayed it to some of our gentlemen in his own hut, by
turning his back and frequently <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>repeating
the expression &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; as a broad hint to them to
go away.&nbsp; Toolooak was also a little given to this mood, but
never retained it long, and there was no malice mixed with his
displeasure.&nbsp; One evening that he slept on board the
<i>Fury</i> he either offended Mr. Skeoch, or thought that he had
done so, by this kind of humour; at all events, they parted for
the night without any formal reconciliation.&nbsp; The next
morning Mr. Skeoch was awakened at an unusually early hour by
Toolooak&rsquo;s entering his cabin and taking hold of his hand
to shake it by way of making up the supposed quarrel.&nbsp; On a
disposition thus naturally charitable, what might not Christian
education and Christian principles effect!&nbsp; Where a joke is
evidently intended, I never knew people more ready to join in it
than these are.&nbsp; If ridiculed for any particularity of
manner, figure, or countenance, they are sure not to be long
behindhand in returning it, and that very often with
interest.&nbsp; If we were the aggressors in this way, some
ironical observation respecting the <i>Kabloonas</i> was
frequently the consequence; and no small portion of wit as well
as irony was at times mixed with their raillery.</p>
<p>In point of intellect, as well as disposition, great variety
was of course perceptible among the different individuals of this
tribe; but few of them were wanting in that respect.&nbsp; Some,
indeed, possessed a degree of natural quickness and intelligence
which perhaps could hardly be surpassed in the natives of any
country.&nbsp; Iligliuk, though one of the least amiable, was
particularly thus gifted.&nbsp; When she really wished to develop
our meaning, she would desire her husband and all the rest to
hold their tongues, and would generally make it out while they
were puzzling their heads to no purpose.&nbsp; In <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>returning her answers, the very expression of her
countenance, though one of the plainest among them, was almost of
itself sufficient to convey her meaning; and there was in these
cases a peculiar decisive energy in her manner of speaking, which
was extremely interesting.&nbsp; This woman would indeed have
easily learned anything to which she chose to direct her
attention; and had her lot been cast in a civilised country
instead of this dreary region, which serves alike to
&ldquo;freeze the genial current of the soul&rdquo; and body, she
would probably have been a very clever person.&nbsp; For want of
a sufficient object, however, neither she nor any of her
companions ever learned a dozen words of English, except our
names, with which it was their interest to be familiar, and
which, long before we left them, any child could repeat, though
in their own style of pronunciation.</p>
<p>Besides the natural authority of parents and husbands, these
people appear to admit no kind of superiority among one another,
except a certain degree of superstitious reverence for their
<i>angetkooks</i>, and their tacitly following the counsel or
steps of the most active seal-catcher on their hunting
excursions.&nbsp; The word <i>nallegak</i>, used in Greenland to
express &ldquo;master,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lord&rdquo; in the
Esquimaux translations of the Scriptures, they were not
acquainted with.&nbsp; One of the young men at Winter Island
appeared to be considered somewhat in the light of a servant to
Okotook, living with the latter, and quietly allowing him to take
possession of all the most valuable presents which he received
from us.&nbsp; Being a sociable people, they unite in
considerable numbers to form a settlement for the winter; but on
the return of spring they again separate into several parties,
each appearing to choose his own route, without regard to that
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>of the rest, but all making their arrangements without
the slightest disagreement or difference of opinion that we could
ever discover.&nbsp; In all their movements they seem to be
actuated by one simultaneous feeling that is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Superior as our arts, contrivances, and materials must
unquestionably have appeared to them, and eager as they were to
profit by this superiority, yet, contradictory as it may seem,
they certainly looked upon us in many respects with profound
contempt, maintaining that idea of self-sufficiency which has
induced them, in common with the rest of their nation, to call
themselves, by way of distinction, <i>Inn&#365;ee</i>, or
mankind.&nbsp; One day, for instance, in securing some of the
gear of a sledge, Okotook broke a part of it composed of a piece
of our white line, and I shall never forget the contemptuous
sneer with which he muttered in soliloquy the word
&ldquo;Kabloona!&rdquo; in token of the inferiority of our
materials to his own.&nbsp; It is happy, perhaps, when people
possessing so few of the good things of this life can be thus
contented with the little allotted them.</p>
<p>The men, though low in stature, are not wanting in muscular
strength in proportion to their size, or in activity and
hardiness.&nbsp; They are good and even quick walkers, and
occasionally bear much bodily fatigue, wet, and cold, without
appearing to suffer by it, much less to complain of it.&nbsp;
Whatever labour they have gone through, and with whatever success
in procuring game, no individual ever seems to arrogate to
himself the credit of having done more than his neighbour for the
general good.&nbsp; Nor do I conceive there is reason to doubt
their personal courage, though they are too good-natured often to
excite others to put that quality to the test.&nbsp; It <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>is
true, they will recoil with horror at the tale of an Indian
massacre, and probably cannot conceive what should induce one set
of men deliberately and without provocation to murder
another.&nbsp; War is not their trade; ferocity forms no part of
the disposition of the Esquimaux.&nbsp; Whatever manly qualities
they possess are exercised in a different way, and put to a far
more worthy purpose.&nbsp; They are fishermen, and not warriors;
but I cannot call that man a coward who, at the age of
one-and-twenty, will attack a Polar bear single-handed, or
fearlessly commit himself to floating masses of ice which the
next puff of wind may drift for ever from the shore.</p>
<p>If, in short, they are deficient in some of the higher
virtues, as they are called, of savage life, they are certainly
free also from some of its blackest vices; and their want of
brilliant qualities is fully compensated by those which, while
they dazzle less, do more service to society and more honour to
human nature.&nbsp; If, for instance, they have not the
magnanimity which would enable them to endure without a murmur
the most excruciating torture, neither have they the ferocious
cruelty that incites a man to inflict that torture on a helpless
fellow-creature.&nbsp; If their gratitude for favours be not
lively nor lasting, neither is their resentment of injuries
implacable, nor their hatred deadly.&nbsp; I do not say there are
not exceptions to this rule, though we have never witnessed any;
but it is assuredly not their general character.</p>
<p>When viewed more nearly in their domestic relations, the
comparison will, I believe, be still more in their favour.&nbsp;
It is here as a social being, as a husband and the father of a
family, promoting within his own little sphere the benefit of
that community in which <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Providence
has cast his lot, that the moral character of a savage is truly
to be sought; and who can turn without horror from the Esquimaux,
peaceably seated after a day of honest labour with his wife and
children in their snow-built hut, to the self-willed and
vindictive Indian, wantonly plunging his dagger into the bosom of
the helpless woman whom nature bids him cherish and protect!</p>
<p>Of the few arts possessed by this simple people some account
has already been given in the description of their various
implements.&nbsp; As mechanics, they have little to boast when
compared with other savages lying under equal disadvantages as to
scantiness of tools and materials.&nbsp; As carpenters, they can
scarf two pieces of wood together, secure them with pins of
whalebone or ivory, fashion the timbers of a canoe, shoe a
paddle, and rivet a scrap of iron into a spear or arrow
head.&nbsp; Their principal tool is the knife (<i>panna</i>),
and, considering the excellence of a great number which they
possessed previous to our intercourse with them, the work they do
is remarkably coarse and clumsy.&nbsp; Their very manner of
holding and handling a knife is the most awkward that can be
imagined.&nbsp; For the purpose of boring holes they have a drill
and bow so exactly like our own that they need no further
description, except that the end of the drill-handle, which our
artists place against their breast, is rested by these people
against a piece of wood or bone held in their mouths, and having
a cavity fitted to receive it.&nbsp; With the use of the saw they
were well acquainted, but had nothing of this kind in their
possession better than a notched piece of iron.&nbsp; One or two
small European axes were lashed to handles in a contrary
direction to ours; that is, to be used like an adze, a form
which, according to the observation <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>of a
traveller well qualified to judge, savages in general
prefer.&nbsp; It was said that these people steamed or boiled
wood in order to bend it for fashioning the timbers of their
canoes.&nbsp; As fishermen or seamen, they can put on a woolding
or seizing with sufficient strength and security, and are
acquainted with some of the most simple and serviceable knots in
use among us.&nbsp; In all the arts, however, practised by the
men, it is observable that the ingenuity lies in the principle,
not in the execution.&nbsp; The experience of ages has led them
to adopt the most efficacious methods, but their practice as
handicrafts has gone no further than absolute necessity requires;
they bestow little labour upon neatness or ornament.</p>
<p>In some of the few arts practised by the women there is much
more dexterity displayed, particularly in that important branch
of a housewife&rsquo;s business, sewing, which even with their
own clumsy needles of bone they perform with extraordinary
neatness.&nbsp; They had, however, several steel needles of a
three-cornered shape, which they kept in a very convenient case,
consisting of a strip of leather passed through a hollow bone and
having its ends remaining out, so that the needles which are
stuck into it may be drawn in and out at pleasure.&nbsp; These
cases were sometimes ornamented by cutting; and several thimbles
of leather, one of which in sewing is worn on the first finger,
are usually attached to it, together with a bunch of narrow
spoons and other small articles liable to be lost.&nbsp; The
thread they use is the sinew of the reindeer (<i>tooktoo
&#277;w&#257;ll&#335;&#335;</i>), or, when they cannot procure
this, the swallow-pipe of the <i>neitiek</i>.&nbsp; This may be
split into threads of different sizes, according to the nature of
their work, and is certainly a most admirable material.&nbsp;
This, together with any other articles of a similar kind, they
<!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>keep in little bags, which are sometimes made of the
skin of birds&rsquo; feet, disposed with the claws downwards in a
very neat and tasteful manner.&nbsp; In sewing, the point of the
needle is entered and drawn through in a direction towards the
body, and not from it or towards one side, as with our
sempstresses.&nbsp; They sew the deer-skins with a &ldquo;round
seam,&rdquo; and the water-tight boots and shoes are
&ldquo;stitched.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter is performed in a very
adroit and efficacious manner, by putting the needle only half
through the substance of one part of the seal-skin, so as to
leave no hole for admitting the water.&nbsp; In cutting out the
clothes, the women do it after one regular and uniform pattern,
which probably descends unaltered from generation to
generation.&nbsp; The skin of the deer&rsquo;s head is always
made to form the apex of the hood, while that of the neck and
shoulders comes down the back of the jacket; and so of every
other part of the animal, which is appropriated to its particular
portion of the dress.&nbsp; To soften the seal-skins of which the
boots, shoes, and mittens are made, the women chew them for an
hour or two together, and the young girls are often seen employed
in thus preparing the materials for their mothers.&nbsp; The
covering of the canoes is a part of the women&rsquo;s business,
in which good workmanship is especially necessary to render the
whole smooth and water-tight.&nbsp; The skins, which are those of
the <i>neitiek</i> only, are prepared by scraping off the hair
and the fleshy parts with an <i>ooloo</i>, and stretching them
out tight on a frame, in which state they are left over the lamps
or in the sun for several days to dry; and after this they are
well chewed by the women to make them fit for working.&nbsp; The
dressing of leather and of skins in the hair is an art which the
women have brought to no inconsiderable degree of <!-- page
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>perfection.&nbsp; They perform this by first cleansing
the skin from as much of the fat and fleshy matter as the
<i>ooloo</i> will take off, and then rubbing it hard for several
hours with a blunt scraper, called <i>si&#257;k&#335;&#335;t</i>,
so as nearly to dry it.&nbsp; It is then put into a vessel
containing urine, and left to steep a couple of days, after which
a drying completes the process.&nbsp; Skins dressed in the hair
are, however, not always thus steeped; the women, instead of
this, chewing them for hours together, till they are quite soft
and clean.&nbsp; Some of the leather thus dressed looked nearly
as well as ours, and the hair was as firmly fixed to the pelt;
but there was in this respect a very great difference, according
to the art or attention of the housewife.&nbsp; Dyeing is an art
wholly unknown to them.&nbsp; The women are very expert at
platting, which is usually done with three threads of sinew; if
greater strength is required, several of these are twisted
slackly together, as in the bowstrings.&nbsp; The quickness with
which some of the women plat is really surprising; and it is well
that they do so, for the quantity required for the bows alone
would otherwise occupy half the year in completing it.</p>
<p>It may be supposed that among so cheerful a people as the
Esquimaux there are many games or sports practised; indeed, it
was rarely that we visited their habitations without seeing some
engaged in them.&nbsp; One of these our gentlemen saw at Winter
Island, on an occasion when most of the men were absent from the
huts on a sealing excursion, and in this Iligliuk was the chief
performer.&nbsp; Being requested to amuse them in this way, she
suddenly unbound her hair, platted it, tied both ends together to
keep it out of her way, and then, stepping out into the middle of
the hut, began to make the most hideous faces that can be
conceived, by drawing both <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>lips into
her mouth, poking forward her chin, squinting frightfully,
occasionally shutting one eye, and moving her head from side to
side as if her neck had been dislocated.&nbsp; This exhibition,
which they call <i>&#257;y&#335;k&#301;t-t&#257;k-poke</i>, and
which is evidently considered an accomplishment that few of them
possess in perfection, distorts every feature in the most
horrible manner imaginable, and would, I think, put our most
skilful horse-collar grinners quite out of countenance.</p>
<p>The next performance consists in looking stedfastly and
gravely forward and repeating the words
<i>t&#259;b&#257;k-tabak</i>, <i>k&#277;ib&#333;-keibo</i>,
<i>k&#277;-b&#257;ng-&#277;-n&#363;-t&#335;-&#277;&#277;k</i>,
<i>kebangenutoeek</i>, <i>&#259;m&#257;t&#259;m&#257;</i>,
<i>amatama</i>, in the order in which they are here placed, but
each at least four times, and always by a peculiar modulation of
the voice, speaking them in pairs, as they are coupled
above.&nbsp; The sound is made to proceed from the throat in a
way much resembling ventriloquism, to which art it is indeed an
approach.&nbsp; After the last <i>amatama</i> Iligliuk always
pointed with her finger towards her body, and pronounced the word
<i>angetkook</i>, steadily retaining her gravity for five or six
seconds, and then bursting into a loud laugh, in which she was
joined by all the rest.&nbsp; The women sometimes produce a much
more guttural and unnatural sound, repeating principally the word
<i>&#299;kk&#277;r&#277;e-ikkeree</i>, coupling them as before,
and staring in such a manner as to make their eyes appear ready
to burst out of their sockets with the exertion.&nbsp; Two or
more of them will sometimes stand up face to face, and with great
quickness and regularity respond to each other, keeping such
exact time that the sound appears to come from one throat instead
of several.&nbsp; Very few of the females are possessed of this
accomplishment, which is called <i>pitkoo-she-r&#257;k-poke</i>,
and it is not <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>uncommon to see several of the
younger females practising it.&nbsp; A third part of the game,
distinguished by the word <i>keit&#299;k-poke</i>, consists only
in falling on each knee alternately, a piece of agility which
they perform with tolerable quickness, considering the bulky and
awkward nature of their dress.</p>
<p>The last kind of individual exhibition was still performed by
Iligliuk, to whom in this, as in almost every thing else, the
other women tacitly acknowledged their inferiority, by quietly
giving place to her on every occasion.&nbsp; She now once more
came forward, and letting her arms hang down loosely and bending
her body very much forward, shook herself with extreme violence,
as if her whole frame had been strongly convulsed, uttering at
the same time, in a wild tone of voice, some of the unnatural
sounds before mentioned.</p>
<p>This being at an end, a new exhibition was commenced, in which
ten or twelve women took a part, and which our gentlemen compared
to blind man&rsquo;s buff.&nbsp; A circle being formed, and a boy
despatched to look out at the door of the hut, Iligliuk, still
the principal actress, placed herself in the centre, and after
making a variety of guttural noises for about half a minute, shut
her eyes, and ran about till she had taken hold of one of the
others, whose business it then became to take her station in the
centre, so that almost every woman in her turn occupied this
post, and in her own peculiar way, either by distortion of
countenance or other gestures, performed her part in the
game.&nbsp; This continued three-quarters of an hour, and, from
the precaution of placing a look-out, who was withdrawn when it
was over, as well as from some very expressive signs which need
not here be mentioned, there is reason to believe that it is
usually <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>followed by certain indecencies,
with which their husbands are not to be acquainted.&nbsp;
Kaoongut was present indeed on this occasion, but his age seemed
to render him a privileged person; besides which his own wife did
not join in the game.</p>
<p>The most common amusement, however, and to which their
husbands made no objection, they performed at Winter Island
expressly for our gratification.&nbsp; The females, being
collected to the number of ten or twelve, stood in as large a
circle as the hut would admit, with Okotook in the centre.&nbsp;
He began by a sort of half-howling, half-singing noise, which
appeared as if designed to call the attention of the women, the
latter soon commencing the <i>Amna Aya</i> song hereafter
described.&nbsp; This they continued without variety, remaining
quite still while Okotook walked round within the circle; his
body was rather bent forward, his eyes sometimes closed, his arms
constantly moving up and down, and now and then hoarsely
vociferating a word or two, as if to increase the animation of
the singers, who, whenever he did this, quitted the chorus and
rose into the words of the song.&nbsp; At the end of ten minutes
they all left off at once, and, after one minute&rsquo;s interval
commenced a second act precisely similar and of equal duration,
Okotook continuing to invoke their Muse as before.&nbsp; A third
act which followed this varied only in his frequently towards the
close throwing his feet up before and clapping his hands
together, by which exertion he was thrown into a violent
perspiration.&nbsp; He then retired, desiring a young man (who,
as we were informed, was the only individual of several then
present thus qualified) to take his place in the centre as master
of the ceremonies, when the same antics as before were again gone
through.&nbsp; After this <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>description
it will scarcely be necessary to remark that nothing can be
poorer in its way than this tedious singing recreation, which, as
well as everything in which dancing is concerned, they express by
the word <i>m&#335;m&#275;k-poke</i>.&nbsp; They seem, however,
to take great delight in it; and even a number of the men, as
well as all the children, crept into the hut by degrees to peep
at the performance.</p>
<p>The Esquimaux women and children often amuse themselves with a
game not unlike our &ldquo;skip-rope.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
performed by two women holding the ends of a line and whirling it
regularly round and round, while a third jumps over it in the
middle according to the following order:&mdash;She commences by
jumping twice on both feet, then alternately with the right and
left, and next four times with the feet slipped one behind the
other, the rope passing once round at each jump.&nbsp; After this
she performs a circle on the ground, jumping about half-a-dozen
times in the course of it, which bringing her to her original
position, the same thing is repeated as often as it can be done
without entangling the line.&nbsp; One or two of the women
performed this with considerable agility and adroitness,
considering the clumsiness of their boots and jackets, and seemed
to pride themselves in some degree on the qualification.&nbsp; A
second kind of this game consists in two women holding a long
rope by its ends and whirling it round in such a manner, over the
heads of two others standing close together near the middle of
the bight, that each of these shall jump over it
alternately.&nbsp; The art therefore, which is indeed
considerable, depends more on those whirling the rope than on the
jumpers, who are, however, obliged to keep exact time, in order
to be ready for the rope passing under their feet.</p>
<p>The whole of these people, but especially the women, <!-- page
179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>are fond of music, both vocal and instrumental.&nbsp;
Some of them might be said to be passionately so, removing their
hair from off their ears and bending their heads forward, as if
to catch the sounds more distinctly, whenever we amused them in
this manner.&nbsp; Their own music is entirely vocal, unless
indeed the drum or tambourine before mentioned be considered an
exception.</p>
<p>The voices of the women are soft and feminine, and when
singing with the men are pitched an octave higher than
theirs.&nbsp; They have most of them so far good ears that, in
whatever key a song is commenced by one of them, the rest will
always join in perfect unison.&nbsp; After singing for ten
minutes, the key had usually fallen a full semitone.&nbsp; Only
two of them, of whom Iligliuk was one, could catch the tune as
pitched by an instrument; which made it difficult with most of
them to complete the writing of the notes, for if they once left
off they were sure to re-commence in some other key, though a
flute or violin were playing at the time.</p>
<p>During the season passed at Winter Island, which appears to
have been a healthy one to the Esquimaux, we had little
opportunity of becoming acquainted with the diseases to which
they are subject.&nbsp; Our subsequent intercourse with a greater
number of these people at Igloolik having unfortunately afforded
more frequent and fatal instances of sickness among them, I here
insert Mr. Edwards&rsquo;s remarks on this subject:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exempted as these people are from a host of diseases
usually ascribed to the vitiated habits of more civilised life,
as well as from those equally numerous and more destructive ones
engendered by the pestilential effluvia that float in the
atmosphere of more favoured climes, the diversity of their
maladies is, as might <i>&agrave; priori</i> be <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>inferred, very limited.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, that
improvidence which is so remarkable in their kindred tribes is
also with them proof against the repeated lessons of bitter
experience they are doomed to endure.&nbsp; Alternate excesses
and privations mark their progress through life, and consequent
misery in one or another shape is an active agent in effecting as
much mischief amongst them as the diseases above alluded to
produce in other countries.&nbsp; The mortality arising from a
few diseases and wretchedness combined, seems sufficient to check
anything like a progressive increase of their numbers.&nbsp; The
great proportion of deaths to births that occurred during the
period of our intercourse with them has already been noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is doubtful in what proportion the mortality is
directly occasioned by disease.&nbsp; Few perhaps die, in the
strict sense of the term, a natural death.&nbsp; A married person
of either sex rarely dies without leaving destitute a parent, a
widow, or a helpless female infant.&nbsp; To be deprived of near
relations is to be deprived of everything; such unfortunates are
usually abandoned to their fate, and too generally perish.&nbsp;
A widow and two or three children left under these circumstances
were known to have died of inanition, from the neglect and apathy
of their neighbours, who jeered at the commanders of our ships on
the failure of their humane endeavours to save what the Esquimaux
considered as worthless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first communication with these people at Winter
Island gave us a more favourable impression of their general
health than subsequent experience confirmed.&nbsp; There,
however, they were not free from sickness.&nbsp; A catarrhal
affection in the month of February became generally prevalent,
from which they readily recovered after the exciting
causes&mdash;intemperance and exposure to <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>wet&mdash;had ceased to operate.&nbsp; A solitary
instance of pleurisy also occurred, which probably might have
ended fatally but for timely assistance.&nbsp; Our intercourse
with them in the summer was more interrupted; but at our
occasional meetings they were observed to be enjoying excellent
health.&nbsp; It is probable that their certain supplies of food,
and the nomad kind of life they lead in its pursuit during that
season, are favourable to health.&nbsp; Nutrition goes on
actively, and an astonishing increase of strength and fulness is
acquired.&nbsp; Active diseases might now be looked for, but that
the powers of nature are providentially exerted with effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unlimited use of stimulating animal food, on which
they are from infancy fed, induces at an early age a highly
plethoric state of the vascular system.&nbsp; The weaker
over-distended vessels of the nose quickly yield to the increased
impetus of the blood, and an active hemorrhage relieves the
subject.&nbsp; As the same causes continue to be applied in
excess at frequent intervals, and are followed by similar
effects, a kind of vicarious hemorrhage at length becomes
established by habit; superseding the intervention of art, and
having no small share in maintaining a balance in the circulating
system.&nbsp; The phenomenon is too constant to have escaped the
observation of those who have visited the different Esquimaux
people; a party of them has indeed rarely been seen that did not
exhibit two or three instances of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the month of September the approach of winter
induced the Esquimaux at Igloolik to abandon their tents and to
retire into their more established village.&nbsp; The majority
were here crowded into huts of a permanent construction, the
materials composing the sides being stones and the bones of
whales, and the roofs being formed <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>of skins,
turf, and snow; the rest of the people were lodged in
snow-huts.&nbsp; For a while they continued very healthy; in
fact, as long as the temperature of the interior did not exceed
the freezing-point, the vapours of the atmosphere congealed upon
the walls, and the air remained dry and tolerably pure; besides,
their hard-frozen winter stock of walrus did not at this time
tempt them to indulge their appetites immoderately.&nbsp; In
January the temperature suffered an unseasonable rise, some
successful captures of walrus also took place, and these
circumstances, combined perhaps with some superstitious customs,
of which we were ignorant, seemed the signal for giving way to
sensuality.&nbsp; The lamps were accumulated and the kettles more
frequently replenished, and gluttony in its most disgusting form
became for a while the order of the day.&nbsp; The Esquimaux were
now seen wallowing in filth, while some surfeited lay stretched
upon their skins enormously distended, and with their friends
employed in rolling them about to assist the operations of
oppressed nature.&nbsp; The roofs of their huts were no longer
congealed, but dripping with wet and threatening speedy
dissolution.&nbsp; The air was in the bone-huts damp, hot, and,
beyond sufferance, offensive with putrid exhalations from the
decomposing relics of offals, or other animal matter, permitted
to remain from year to year undisturbed in these horrible
sinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the consequences might have been had this state of
affairs long continued, it is not difficult to imagine; but,
fortunately for them, an early and gradual dispersion took place,
so that by the end of January few individuals were left in the
village.&nbsp; The rest, in divided bodies, established
themselves in snow-huts upon the sea-ice at some distance from
the land.&nbsp; Before this change had <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>been
completed, disorders of an inflammatory character had
appeared.&nbsp; A few went away sick, some were unable to remove,
and others taken ill upon the ice, and we heard of the death of
several about this period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cold snow-huts into which they had moved, though
infinitely preferable to those abandoned, were ill-suited to the
reception of people already sick or predisposed, from the
above-named causes, to sickness; many of them were also deficient
in clothing to meet the rigorous weather that followed.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, after this violent excitement had passed away, a
comparatively good condition of health was enjoyed for the
remainder of the winter and spring months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their distance from the ships at once precluded any
effectual assistance being rendered them at their huts, and their
removal on board with safety; the complaints of those who died at
the huts, therefore, did not come under observation.&nbsp; It
appears, however, to have been acute inflammation of some of the
abdominal viscera, very rapid in its career.&nbsp; In the
generality the disease assumed a more insidious and sub-acute
form, under which the patient lingered for a while, and was then
either carried off by a diarrh&oelig;a or slowly recovered by the
powers of nature.&nbsp; Three or four individuals who, with some
risk and trouble, were brought to the ships, we were
providentially instrumental in recovering; but two others, almost
helpless patients, were so far exhausted before their arrival
that the endeavours used were unsuccessful, and death was
probably hastened by their removal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdominal and thoracic inflammations, in fact, seem to
be the only active diseases they have to encounter.&nbsp; Where a
spontaneous recovery does not take place, these <!-- page
184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>prove fatal in a short time.&nbsp; The only instance
among them of chronic sequels to those complaints occurred in an
old man almost in dotage, whose feeble remains of life were
wasting away by an ulceration of the lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No traces of the exanthematous disorders met our
observation.&nbsp; A solitary case of epilepsy was seen in a deaf
and dumb boy, who eventually died.&nbsp; Chronic rheumatism
occurs, but it is rare and not severe.&nbsp; I have some doubt in
saying that scurvy exists among them.&nbsp; A disease, however,
having a close affinity to it was witnessed, but as in the only
case that came fairly under our notice it was complicated with
the symptoms of a previous debilitating disease, the diagnosis
was difficult.&nbsp; During the patient&rsquo;s recovery from one
of the abdominal attacks above mentioned, the gums were observed
to be spongy, separated from the teeth and reverted, bleeding,
and in various parts presenting the livid appearance of scorbutic
gums.&nbsp; At the same period arose pains of an anomalous
description, and of considerable severity about the shoulders and
thorax.&nbsp; These gradually yielded as he recovered strength,
but were succeeded by other pains and tenderness of the bones and
muscles of the thighs and legs.&nbsp; The citric acid was given
to him freely from the beginning, until it interfered with his
appetite and bowels, when it was omitted.&nbsp; Topical
applications were at the same time used, and afterwards
continued.&nbsp; Signs of amendment appeared before it became
necessary to withhold the vegetable acid, and it was not recurred
to while he remained on board.&nbsp; Urged by impatience of
control, he left us to join his countrymen before he had well
regained his strength; but we saw him on board several times
afterwards in a progressive state of improvement, and, though yet
weak, free from scorbutic symptoms.&nbsp; <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Another
instance offered in a woman, whom I saw but once.&nbsp; Her gums
were spongy and reverted, but not discoloured; her countenance
sallow, lips pale, and she suffered under general debility,
without local pain or rigidity of the limbs.&nbsp; She remained
in this state for a long time, and eventually, as the weather
improved, recovered without assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That affection of the eyes known by the name of
snow-blindness, is extremely frequent among these people.&nbsp;
With them it scarcely ever goes beyond painful irritation, whilst
among strangers inflammation is sometimes the consequence.&nbsp;
I have not seen them use any other remedy besides the exclusion
of light; but as a preventive a wooden eye-screen is worn, very
simple in its construction, consisting of a curved piece of wood
six or seven inches long and ten or twelve lines broad.&nbsp; It
is tied over the eyes like a pair of spectacles, being adapted to
the forehead and nose, and hollowed out to favour the motion of
the eyelids.&nbsp; A few rays of light only are admitted through
a narrow slit an inch long, cut opposite to each eye.&nbsp; This
contrivance is more simple and quite as efficient as the more
heavy one possessed by some who have been fortunate enough to
acquire wood for the purpose.&nbsp; This is merely the former
instrument complicated by the addition of a horizontal plate
projecting three or four inches from its upper rim, like the peak
of a jockey&rsquo;s cap.&nbsp; In Hudson&rsquo;s Strait the
latter is common, and the former in Greenland, where also we are
told they wear with advantage the simple horizontal peak
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are upon the whole no people more destitute of
curative means than these.&nbsp; With the exception of the <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>hemorrhage already mentioned, which they duly
appreciate, and have been observed to excite artificially to cure
head-ache, they are ignorant of any rational method of procuring
relief.&nbsp; It has not been ascertained that they use a single
herb medicinally.&nbsp; As prophylactics they wear amulets, which
are usually the teeth, bones, or hair of some animal, the more
rare apparently the more valuable.&nbsp; In absolute sickness
they depend entirely upon their Angekoks, who, they persuade
themselves, have influence over some submarine deities who govern
their destiny.&nbsp; The mummeries of these impostors, consisting
in pretended consultations with their oracles, are looked upon
with confidence, and their mandates, however absurd,
superstitiously submitted to.&nbsp; These are constituted of
unmeaning ceremonies and prohibitions generally affecting the
diet, both in kind and mode, but never in quantity.&nbsp;
Seal&rsquo;s flesh is forbidden, for instance, in one disease,
that of the walrus in the other; the heart is denied to some and
the liver to others.&nbsp; A poor woman, on discovering that the
meat she had in her mouth was a piece of fried heart instead of
the liver, appeared horrorstruck; and a man was in equal
tribulation at having eaten, by mistake, a piece of meat cooked
in his wife&rsquo;s kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This charlatanerie, although we may ridicule the
imposition, is not, however, with them, as it is with us, a
positive evil.&nbsp; In the total absence of the medical art, it
proves generally innoxious; while in many instances it must be a
source of real benefit and comfort, by buoying up the sick spirit
with confident hopes of recovery, and eventually enabling the
vital powers to rise superior to the malady, when, without such
support, the sufferer <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>might have sunk under its
weight.&nbsp; It was attempted to ascertain whether climate
effected any difference in animal heat between them and ourselves
by frequently marking the temperature of the mouth; but the
experiments were necessarily made, as occasion offered, under
such various states of vascular excitement, as to afford nothing
conclusive.&nbsp; As it was, their temperature varied from
97&deg; to 102&deg;, coinciding pretty nearly with our own under
similar circumstances.&nbsp; The pulse offered nothing
singular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may here remark that there is in many individuals a
peculiarity about the eye, amounting in some instances to
deformity, which I have not noticed elsewhere.&nbsp; It consists
in the inner corner of the eye being entirely covered by a
duplication of the adjacent loose skin of the eyelids and
nose.&nbsp; This fold is lightly stretched over the edges of the
eyelids, and forms, as it were, a third palpebra of a crescentic
shape.&nbsp; The aperture is in consequence rendered somewhat
pyriform, the inner curvature being very obtuse, and in some
individuals distorted by an angle formed where the fold crosses
the border of the lower palpebra.&nbsp; This singularity depends
upon the variable form of the orbit during immature age, and is
very remarkable in childhood, less so towards adult age, and
then, it would seem, frequently disappearing altogether; for the
proportion in which it exists among grown-up persons bears but a
small comparison with that observed among the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personal deformity from mal-conformation is uncommon,
the only instance I remember being that of a young woman, whose
utterance was unintelligibly nasal, in consequence of an
imperfect development of <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>the
palatine bones leaving a gap in the roof of the mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The imperfect arithmetic of these people, which resolves every
number above ten into one comprehensive word, prevented our
obtaining any very certain information respecting the population
of this part of North America and its adjacent islands.&nbsp; The
principal stations of these people not visited by us are
<i>Akkoolee</i>, <i>Toonoonee-roochiuh</i>, <i>Peelig</i>, and
<i>Toonoonek</i>, of whose situation I have already spoken.&nbsp;
The first of these, which is the only one situated on the
continent, lies in an indentation of considerable depth on the
shores of the Polar Sea, running in towards Repulse Bay on the
opposite coast, and forming with it the large peninsula situated
like a bastion at the north-east angle of America, which I have
named Melville Peninsula, in honour of Viscount Melville, the
First Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty.&nbsp; From what we know
of the habits and disposition of the Esquimaux, which incline
them always to associate in considerable numbers, we cannot well
assign a smaller population than fifty souls to each of the four
principal stations above-mentioned; and including these, and the
inhabitants of several minor ones that were occasionally named to
us, there may perhaps be three or four hundred people belonging
to this tribe with whom we have never had communication.&nbsp; In
all their charts of this neighbourhood they also delineate a
tract of land to the eastward, and somewhat to the northward, of
Igloolik, where they say the <i>Seadl&#275;rmeoo</i>, or
strangers, live, with whom, as with the Esquimaux of Southampton
Island, and all others coming under the same denomination, they
have seldom or never any intercourse, either of a friendly or a
hostile <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>nature.&nbsp; It is more than
probable that the natives of the inlet called the river Clyde, on
the western coast of Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, are a part of the people
thus designated; and, indeed, the whole of the numerous bays and
inlets on that extensive and productive line of coast may be the
residence of great numbers of Esquimaux, of whom these people
possess no accurate information.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the abundance sometimes enjoyed by these
people, and whatever the maladies occasioned by their too
frequent abuse of it, it is certain that they occasionally suffer
very severely from the opposite extreme.&nbsp; A remarkably
intelligent woman informed Captain Lyon that two years ago some
Esquimaux arrived at Igloolik from a place near Akkoolee,
bringing information that during a very grievous famine one party
of men had fallen upon another and killed them; and that they
afterwards subsisted on their flesh while in a frozen state, but
never cooked nor even thawed it.&nbsp; This horrible account was
soon after confirmed by Toolemak on board the <i>Fury</i>; and
though he was evidently uneasy at our having heard the story, and
conversed upon it with reluctance, yet by means of our questions
he was brought to name, upon his fingers, five individuals who
had been killed on this occasion.&nbsp; Of the fact therefore
there can be no doubt; but it is certain, also, that we ourselves
scarcely regarded it with greater horror than those who related
it; and the occurrence may be considered similar to those
dreadful instances on record, even among civilised nations, of
men devouring one another, in wrecks or boats, when rendered
desperate by the sufferings of actual starvation.</p>
<p>The ceremony of crying, which has before been <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>mentioned as practised after a person&rsquo;s death, is
not, however, altogether confined to those melancholy occasions,
but is occasionally adopted in cases of illness, and that of no
very dangerous kind.&nbsp; The father of a sick person enters the
apartment, and after looking at him for a few seconds without
speaking, announces by a kind of low sob his preparation for the
coming ceremony.&nbsp; At this signal every other individual
present composes his features for crying, and the leader of the
chorus then setting up a loud and piteous howl, which lasts about
a minute, is joined by all the rest, who shed abundant tears
during the process.&nbsp; So decidedly is this a matter of form,
unaccompanied by any feeling of sorrow, that those who are not
relatives shed just as many tears as those that are; to which may
be added that in the instances which we witnessed there was no
real occasion for crying at all.&nbsp; It must therefore be
considered in the light of a ceremony of condolence, which it
would be either indecorous or unlucky to omit.</p>
<p>I have already given several instances of the little care
these people take in the interment of their dead, especially in
the winter season; it is certain, however, that this arises from
some superstitious notion, and particularly from the belief that
any heavy weight upon the corpse would have an injurious effect
upon the deceased in a future state of existence; for even in the
summer, when it would be an easy matter to secure a body from the
depredations of wild animals, the mode of burial is not
essentially different.&nbsp; The corpse of a child observed by
Lieutenant Palmer, he describes &ldquo;as being laid in a regular
but shallow grave, with its head to the north-east.&nbsp; It was
decently dressed in a good deer-skin jacket, <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>and a
seal-skin, prepared without the hair, was carefully placed as a
cover to the whole figure, and tucked in on all sides.&nbsp; The
body was covered with flat pieces of limestone, which, however,
were so light that a fox might easily have removed them.&nbsp;
Near the grave were four little separate piles of stones, not
more than a foot in height, in one of which we noticed a piece of
red cloth and a black silk handkerchief, in a second a pair of
child&rsquo;s boots and mittens, and in each of the others a
whalebone pot.&nbsp; The face of the child looked unusually clean
and fresh, and a few days only could have elapsed since its
decease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Esquimaux do not appear to have any idea of the
existence of One Supreme Being, nor indeed can they be said to
entertain any notions on this subject, which may be dignified
with the name of Religion.&nbsp; Their superstitions, which are
numerous, have all some reference to the preternatural agency of
a number of <i>to&#333;rng&#335;w</i>, or spirits, with whom, on
certain occasions, the Angetkooks pretend to hold mysterious
intercourse, and who in various and distinct ways are supposed to
preside over the destinies of the Esquimaux.&nbsp; On particular
occasions of sickness or want of food the Angetkooks contrive, by
means of a darkened hut, a peculiar modulation of the voice, and
the uttering of a variety of unintelligible sounds, to persuade
their countrymen that they are descending to the lower regions
for this purpose, where they force the spirits to communicate the
desired information.&nbsp; The superstitious reverence in which
these wizards are held, and a considerable degree of ingenuity in
their mode of performing their mummery, prevent the detection of
the imposture, and secure implicit confidence in these absurd
oracles.&nbsp; My <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>friend Captain Lyon having
particularly directed his attention to this part of their history
during the whole of our intercourse with these people, and
intending to publish his Journal, which contains much interesting
information of this nature, I shall not here enter more at large
on the subject.&nbsp; Some account of their ideas respecting
death, and of their belief in a future state of existence, have
already been introduced in the course of the foregoing pages, in
the order of those occurrences which furnished us with
opportunities of observing them.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
